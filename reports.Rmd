  #### With sufficient finance, nature-based solutions (NbS) provide the means to cost-effectively reach climate, ***biodiversity*** and land degradation neutrality targets, particularly if investments simultaneously contribute to ***biodiversity*** (National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans [NBSAPs]), climate (Nationally determined contributions [NDC]) and restoration (Land Degradation Neutrality [LDN]) targets. This “double” or “triple” win potential is particularly alluring given the current economic situation...Delayed action is no longer an option in the face of the devastating effects of climate change, the extinction crisis and severe land degradation globally. Politicians, business and finance leaders and citizens globally must transform their relationship with nature to work with it rather than against it...Private sector investment in NbS must increase by several orders of magnitude in the coming years...Nature-negative expenditures far outweigh investments in nature-based solutions...increase direct finance flows to NbS through public domestic expenditure, nature-focused Official Development Assistance (ODA), ensuring that multilateral development banks (MDBs) and development finance institutions (DFIs) prioritise green finance, and providing regulation and incentives for private sector investment, particularly in nature markets and sustainable supply chains.

  #### The way nature is valued in political and economic decisions is both a key driver of the global ***biodiversity crisis*** and a vital opportunity to address it...Economic and political decisions have predominantly prioritised certain values of nature, particularly market-based instrumental values of nature, such as those associated with food produced intensively. Although often privileged in policymaking, these market values do not adequately reflect how changes in nature affect people’s quality of life. Furthermore, policymaking overlooks the many non-market values associated with nature’s contributions to people, such as climate regulation and cultural identity.

  #### Since the 1960s, human use of synthetic Nr fertilizers has increased 9-fold globally and a further substantial increase of around 40-50% is expected over the next 40 years based on current trends. Together with increased fossil fuel combustion, humans have now created excess Nr pollution that spans all environmental compartments with multiple threats, to the extent that the disruption of the natural nitrogen cycle is now one of the greatest global threats to the environment of the 21st century. Key N threats include: reductions in ***biodiversity***  (i.e. degradation of sensitive habitats); accelerated climate change via the production of nitrous oxide gas (N2O); widespread air pollution leading to growing incidences of upper respiratory disease and cancer in humans; depletion of stratospheric ozone layer via the production of nitrous oxide gas (N2O); eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and hypoxic “dead zones” in the coastal ocean; and acidification of soils and forests of natural ecosystems.

  </a>
  
  #### The amount of marine litter and plastic pollution has been growing rapidly. Emissions of plastic waste into aquatic ecosystems are projected to nearly triple  by 2040 without meaningful action. Marine litter and plastics present a serious threat to all marine life, while also influencing the climate. Plastics are the largest, most harmful and most persistent fraction of marine litter, accounting for at least 85 per cent of total marine waste...Plastics can also alter global carbon cycling through their effect on plankton and primary production in marine, freshwater and terrestrial systems. Marine ecosystems, especially mangroves, seagrasses, corals and salt marshes, play a major role in sequestering carbon. The more damage we do to oceans and coastal areas, the harder it is for these ecosystems to both offset and remain resilient to climate change.[***See* report**](https://www.unep.org/resources/pollution-solution-global-assessment-marine-litter-and-plastic-pollution){target="_blank"}.

  #### It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred. Observed increases in well-mixed greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations since around 1750 are unequivocally caused by human activities. Since 2011 (measurements reported in AR5), concentrations have continued to increase in the atmosphere, reaching annual averages of 410 parts per million (ppm) for carbon dioxide (CO2), 1866 parts per billion (ppb) for methane (CH4), and 332 ppb for nitrous oxide (N2O) in 2019. Land and ocean have taken up a near-constant proportion (globally about 56% per year) of CO2 emissions from human activities over the past six decades, with regional differences.

  #### Nature loss is at the heart of many societal challenges, while nature-based solutions hold the potential to address interlinked crises...The integrity of the Earth’s ecosystems has been significantly compromised as a result of human activity and the paradigm that has prioritised short-term economic growth...The report finds that approximately USD 133 billion/year currently flows into NbS (using 2020 as base year), with public funds making up 86 per cent and private finance 14 per cent...Looking to the future, investment in NbS ought to at least triple in real terms by 2030 and increase four-fold by 2050 if the world is to meet its climate change, ***biodiversity*** and land degradation targets.

  #### Humanity’s environmental challenges have grown in number and severity ever since the Stockholm Conference in 1972 and now represent a planetary emergency...Over the last 50 years, the global economy has grown nearly fivefold, due largely to a tripling in extraction of natural resources and energy that has fuelled growth in production and consumption. The world population has increased by a factor of two, to 7.8 billion people, and though on average prosperity has also doubled, about 1.3 billion people remain poor and some 700 million are hungry. The increasingly unequal and resource-intensive model of development drives environmental decline through climate change, ***biodiversity loss*** and other forms of pollution and resource degradation.

  #### Nature is more than a mere economic good. Nature nurtures and nourishes us, so we will think of assets as durable entities that not only have use value, but may also have intrinsic worth. Once we make that extension, the economics of ***biodiversity*** becomes a study in portfolio management...But in addition to mobility, Nature has two properties that make the economics of ***biodiversity*** markedly different from the economics that informs our intuitions about the character of produced capital.

  #### The global Living Planet Index continues to decline. It shows an average 68% decrease in population sizes of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish between 1970 and 2016. A 94% decline in the LPI for the tropical subregions of the Americas is the largest fall observed in any part of the world. Why does this matter? It matters because ***biodiversity*** is fundamental to human life on Earth, and the evidence is unequivocal – it is being destroyed by us at a rate unprecedented in history. Since the industrial revolution, human activities have increasingly destroyed and degraded forests, grasslands, wetlands and other important ecosystems, threatening human well-being.

More than 800 species are already known to be affected by marine plastic pollution, including all sea turtle species, more than 40 per cent of cetacean species, and 44 per cent of marine bird species.

  #### Insects are an important source of both ecosystem services and ecosystem disservices. Recent studies have indicated a worrying decline in insect species, especially in flying insects in the northern temperate region, and this has spawned much media attention. Some decline has occurred, it is clear, due to agricultural intensification, urbanization, overuse of pesticides, and global climate change. A decline would seriously affect the ecosystem services that insects provide. However, there is too little data to warrant the belief that all insects are declining everywhere. There is a pressing need for more basic research on insect diversity in the context of a changing world.

  #### Exploding human consumption is the driving force behind the unprecedented planetary change we are witnessing, through the increased demand for energy, land and water. Consumption indicators – such as the Ecological Footprint – provide a picture of overall resource use. The products we consume, the supply chains behind them, the materials they use and how these are extracted and manufactured have myriad impacts on the world around us.

  #### The realisation that fungi are closer to animals than plants is, however, only one of a number of remarkable facts to emerge in the past few decades. It is now becoming apparent that these organisms, which often cannot be seen with the naked eye and spend vast parts of their life cycle underground or inside plants and animals, are responsible for incredibly important processes; these include global cycling of nutrients, carbon sequestration, and even the prevention of desertification in some drought-prone regions of the world. Fungi also underpin products and processes that we rely heavily on in aspects of everyday life, from critical drugs (including statins, the class of medication used to lower blood cholesterol), to synthesis of biofuels, to cleaning up the environment through bioremediation. Some have multiple uses; for example, species of Penicillium have uses as diverse as in antibiotics, the synthesis of third-generation contraceptive pills and cheese production. The global market in edible mushrooms is also huge and increasing. [***See* report**](https://kew.iro.bl.uk/concern/reports/e30de436-455d-410e-8605-8c533a0398ce?locale=en){target="_blank"}.

On average, monitored species population abundance declined by 58 per cent between 1970 and 2012.

  #### About 209,000 protected areas (PAs) cover 15.4% of the planet’s terrestrial and inland water areas, and 3.4 % of the oceans. 8.4% of all marine areas within national jurisdiction (0-200 nautical miles) are covered protected areas while only 0.25% of marine areas beyond national jurisdiction are protected. Protected areas do not sufficiently cover areas of particular importance for ***biodiversity*** (only 22-23% are completely covered by PAs), and many terrestrial and marine ecoregions are still poorly represented. There is good evidence that effectively managed PAs conserve ***biodiversity and habitats***, on land and sea. However, by 2013, only 29% of the area of nationally designated PAs had been assessed for Protected Area Management Effectiveness (PAME).

Extrapolations for a range of indicators suggest that based on current trends, pressures on ***biodiversity*** will continue to increase at least until 2020, and that the status of ***biodiversity*** will continue to decline. This is despite the fact that society’s responses to the ***loss of biodiversity*** are increasing dramatically, and based on national plans and commitments are expected to continue to increase for the remainder of this decade.

  #### Within the Earth System – which acts as a single, self-regulating system comprised of physical, chemical, biological and human components – the effects of human activities can be detected at a planetary scale (Chapter 7). These have led scientists to define a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene, based on evidence that atmospheric, geological, hydrological, biological and other Earth System processes are being altered by human activity. The most readily recognized changes include a rise in global temperatures and sea levels, and ocean acidification, all associated with the increase in emissions of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide and methane (Chapters 2 and 4). Other human-induced changes include extensive deforestation and land clearance for agriculture and urbanization, causing species extinctions as natural habitats are destroyed (Chapters 3 and 5).

  #### Within the vast immensity of the universe, a thin layer of life encircles a planet. Bound by rock below and space above, millions of diverse species thrive. Together, they form the ecosystems and habitats we so readily recognize as planet Earth – and which, in turn, supply a multitude of ecosystem services upon which people, and all life, depend. Ever-growing human demand for resources, however, is putting tremendous pressures on ***biodiversity***. This threatens the continued provision of ecosystem services, which not only further threatens ***biodiversity*** but also our own species’ future security, health and well-being.

Although the majority of Arctic species examined in this report are currently stable or increasing, some species of importance to Arctic people or species of global significance are declining. Climate change is emerging as the most far reaching and significant stressor on Arctic ***biodiversity***. However, contaminants, habitat fragmentation, industrial development, and unsustainable harvest levels continue to have impacts.

  #### Research since IPCC AR4 has served to strengthen the conclusion that ***biodiversity*** is important in mitigating climate change. This importance stems from the role of ecosystems in the carbon cycle. Ecosystems sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then store it. Human-induced changes in those ecosystems can lead either to increased sequestration of carbon dioxide or to increased emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Promoting the former type of change and reducing the latter type of change can make a very significant contribution to climate change mitigation. The use of ecosystem-based mitigation policies can also contribute to sustaining a variety of ecosystem services including ***biodiversity*** conservation [***See* report**](https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/8199){target="_blank"}.

These co-benefits can significantly reduce the overall cost to the economy of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions.

  #### The aim of this study is to explore policy options that could have major positive or negative impacts on ***biodiversity***. The main question is whether the 2010 Biodiversity Target can be met at global and regional levels. Effects up to 2050 are taken into account. According to a business as usual scenario (baseline), and six individual options, it is unlikely that the 2010 target will be met at either global level or regional level. The loss of ***biodiversity*** is expected to continue at an unchanged pace in the coming decades. Key drivers, global population and economic activity are expected to keep on growing. Between 2000 and 2050, the global population is projected to grow by 50% and the global economy to quadruple. The need for food, fodder, energy and wood will unavoidably lead to a decrease in the global natural stocks. The negative impact of climate change, nitrogen deposition, fragmentation, infrastructure and unchecked human settlement on ***biodiversity*** will further expand.

(b) Trends of some 3,000 wild populations of species show a consistent decline in average species abundance of about 40% between 1970 and 2000; inland water species declined by 50%, while marine and terrestrial species both declined by around 30%... (c) More species are becoming threatened with extinction. The status of bird species show a continuing deterioration across all biomes over the last two decades and preliminary findings for other major groups, such as amphibians and mammals, indicate that the situation is likely worse than for birds...The threats to ***biodiversity*** are generally increasing.

  #### Everyone in the world depends completely on Earth’s ecosystems and the services they provide, such as food, water, disease management, climate regulation, spiritual fulfillment, and aesthetic enjoyment. Over the past 50 years, humans have changed these ecosystems more rapidly and extensively than in any comparable period of time in human history, largely to meet rapidly growing demands for food, fresh water, timber, fiber, and fuel. This transformation of the planet has contributed to substantial net gains in human well-being and economic development. But not all regions and groups of people have benefited from this process—in fact, many have been harmed. Moreover, the full costs associated with these gains are only now becoming apparent.

For every species that goes extinct, many populations have become extinct (termed local extinction or extirpation)...Causes of extinction, i.e. those factors that make populations vulnerable to extinction in the first place, include habitat degradation (loss, change in quality and fragmentation), over-exploitation and persecution, and introductions of alien species...The rich complexity of both the physical environment and the interactions among organisms and species appears to be crucial for the maintenance and generation of ***biodiversity***. Thus, the ecosystem and its component communities appear to be very appropriate targets for conservation, because they take into account explicitly the many ecological interactions between organisms and their biotic and abiotic natural environment. A space-orientated approach up to the landscape scale may be the most appropriate tool with which to conserve the vast majority of ***biological diversity***.

  #### ***Biodiversity***, the product of millions of years of biological evolution has always provided mankind with food, fibre, shelter, medicines and socio-cultural enrichment. Yet we are destroying vast numbers of invaluable species and genetic combinations and compromising vital terrestrial and aquatic habitats and ecosystems at a time when human dependence on genetic resources and ecological services of ecosystems is increasing rapidly due to human population growth...Such changes call for a major recasting of political principles and covenants/contracts governing international co-operation, production and consumption patterns, exchange of commodities and information, as well as transfer of technologies including biotechnology. It calls for charting a new path, with a new vision, vigour and renewed mandate. It calls for an effective implementation strategy.

  #### Three times since its inception (1982, 1987 and 1992) UNEP has undertaken a more wide-ranging study. The results of the present study are the most disturbing of the three....The World Environment 1972-1992 offers a look at the environment from three perspectives. Ten introductory chapters detail the range of environmental threats and examine how they have unfolded over the past two decades. The threats include those that were well known two decades ago, such as toxic chemicals, air and water pollution, and land degradation (desertlilcation, deforestation and soil loss). They also include those that have emerged over the period under review - stratospheric ozone depletion, ***loss of biodiversity*** and climate change.

  #### The relatively recent explosion in 'green' thinking and policy making worldwide, together with the concern at the rate of ***loss of both species and habitats***, has led to a growing demand for up-to-date facts and figures about plant species and vegetation types and how they should be conserved. Fortunately, much has been published on this subject in recent years, yet there has been no obvious route for the conservation and development community to gain access to this information quickly and easily. The relevant literature tends to be markedly mulu- disciplinary, and is thinly scattered across such varied fields as botany, forestry, ecology, horticulture, planning, economics, politics and environmental law...This volume contains over 10,000 reference citations to published literature considered relevant to international, national or local plant conservation.

  #### Environmental indicators reveal mixed signals. improvement, stabilization, and deterioration...Rapid destruction of natural environments is reducing the number of species and the amount of genetic variation within individual species. So ***biological diversity*** is declining. If this trend is not hailed and reversed it could have serious and far-reaching repercussions for humanity. ***Biological diversity*** must be seen as a global resource, like the atmosphere or the oceans. All nations have a common interest in it and all have a common responsibility towards it. Despite such action as has already been taken to promote conservation, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive strategy, including a global convention to provide a strong legal basis for international co-operation in conserving ***biological diversity***.

  #### But the "environment" is where we all live; and "development" is what we all do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are inseparable. Further, development issues must be seen as crucial by the political leaders who feel that their countries have reached a plateau towards which other nations must strive. Many of the development paths of the industrialized nations are clearly unsustainable. And the development decisions of these countries, because of their great economic and political power, will have a profound effect upon the ability of all peoples to sustain human progress for generations to come. Many critical survival issues are related to uneven development, poverty, and population growth. They all place unprecedented pressures on the planet's lands, waters, forests, and other natural resources, not least in the developing countries. The downward spiral of poverty and environmental degradation is a waste of opportunities and of resources. In particular, it is a waste of human resources. These links between poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation formed a major theme in our analysis and recommendations. What is needed now is a new era of economic growth - growth that is forceful and at the same time socially and environmentally sustainable.

  #### The condition of the physical environment, so obviously a focus of emphasis in the years leading up to Stockholm, has become of lesser concern to those commissioning these reviews. As the chapters of the present volume reveal, this shift of emphasis does not mean that there have not been significant changes in the physical environment. Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere continued to rise, concern about acid rains grew, and fears about man's impact on stratospheric ozone remained. The pollution of the oceans and inland waters and the loss of soil and of productivity through erosion, desertification and salinity, were at the forefront of attention. The depletion of ***genetic resources***, especially in the tropical forests, was much debated. The volume and number of manufactured chemicals reaching the environment increased enormously.

  #### Land and water are important requirements for food production. As the need to increase food production becomes more urgent, man is faced with continued loss of productive soil through desertification, erosion, salination and other forms of destructive land use...Overlogging of tropical forests has had similar effects. It is estimated that already man's activities have despoiled some 10 per cent of the world's arable land. In addition, good agricultural land is coming under intense pressure, in both developed and developing countries, from urban uses. There is still land available which can be brought under cultivation, but as larger and larger areas are given over to farming, the unexploited tracts available to serve as reservoirs of ***species diversity*** and natural ecosystems become smaller and smaller.

  #### Man is both creature and moulder of his environment, which gives him physical sustenance and affords him the opportunity for intellectual, moral, social and spiritual growth. In the long and tortuous evolution of the human race on this planet a stage has been reached when, through the rapid acceleration of science and technology, man has acquired the power to transform his environment in countless ways and on an unprecedented scale. Both aspects of man’s environment, the natural and the man-made, are essential to his well-being and to the enjoyment of basic human rights-even the right to life itself...A point has been reached in history when we must shape our actions throughout the world with a more prudent care for their environmental consequences. Through ignorance or indifference we can do massive and irreversible harm to the earthly environment on which our life and well-being depend.

  #### In the discussions held by the General Assembly at its twenty-third session it was emphasized that for the first time in the history of mankind, there is arising a crisis of world-wide proportions involving developed and developing countries alike -the crisis of the human environment. Portents of this crisis have long been apparent- in the explosive growth of human populations, in the poor integration of a powerful and efficient technology with environmental requirements, in the deterioration of agricultural lands, in the unplanned extension of urban areas, in the decrease of available space and the growing danger of extinction of many forms of animal and plant life. It is becoming apparent that if current trends continue, the future of life on earth could be endangered. It is urgent, therefore, to focus world attention on those problems which threaten humanity in an environment that permits the realization of the highest human aspirations, and on the action necessary to deal with them.

  #### Generally, emphasis has been put on work programmes concerned with pollution of the human environment, this being an aspect of the subject-matter outlined in the Swedish memornndum which has up to the present time concerned United Nations organizations and prograrmues more than others. Pollution of the environment, air, water and soiil, from different sources, is dealt with by the ILO, FAO, UNESCO, WHO, WMO, IAEA and, on the regional level, ECE. Pollution of the sea caused by ships is the concern of IMCO. Pollution caused by radiation is the concern of IAEA, UNSCEAR, WHO and FAO. The proper and rational use of land, including problems of soil erosion, soil conservation and the establishment and protection of forests, is being studied particularly by FAO.
