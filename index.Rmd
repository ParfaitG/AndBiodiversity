#### Why _And Biodiversity_? To mainstream the issue across domains:

<br/>

<div class="stick_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_media.png" alt="media person icon"/></div>

#### **Media**

> #### "We continue to provide the latest on our series on Climate Change ***and Biodiversity Loss***."

<br/>

<div class="stick_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_politician.png" alt="politician icon"/></div>

#### **Politics**

> #### "Climate change ***and biodiversity loss*** are existential threats and are on the ballot this election."

<br/>

<div class="stick_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_business.png" alt="business icon"/></div>

#### **Business**

> #### "We forecast in next quarter into next few fiscal years losses due to climate change ***and biodiversity loss***."

<br/>

<div class="stick_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_school.png" alt="school icon"/></div>

#### **Education**

> #### "Class, we will continue our lesson on issues very important to the Earth: climate change ***and biodiversity loss***."

<br/>

<div class="stick_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_protesters.png" alt="protester icon"/></div>

#### **Activism**

> #### "Save our planet from the Climate Crisis ***and Biodiversity Crisis!***"

<br/>

<div class="stick_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_talking.png" alt="people talking icon"/></div>

#### **Civil Society**

> #### "You know I'm really starting to worry about climate change ***and biodiversity loss***."

<br/>


#### Why _And Biodiversity_? To raise awareness of nature-based solutions:

<br/>


<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_heatwave.png" alt="heatwave icon"/></div>

#### **Heatwaves**

> #### Climate change causes prolonged and intense heatwaves, ***and biodiversity*** with transpiration of trees and plants can bring a coolness and reduce urban heat island effects.

<br/>


<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_flood.png" alt="flooding icon"/></div>

#### **Flooding**

> #### Climate change causes more extreme weather events, ***and biodiversity*** with healthy rivers, wetlands, and coral reefs across coastlines and floodplains can absorb and buffer storm surges and flooding.

<br/>

<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_crops.png" alt="crops icon"/></div>

#### **Famine**

> #### Climate change causes more crop yields to decline, ***and biodiversity*** with rich soil organisms can regulate and regenerate soil health and with diverse crops and livestock can stabilize food supply. 

<br/>


<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_waterlevel.png" alt="low water icon"/></div>

#### **Drought**

> #### Climate change causes more widespread droughts, ***and biodiversity*** with healthy freshwater ecosystems can regulate water quality, flow, supply, and enhance groundwater systems.

<br/>

<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_pests.png" alt="pests icon"/></div>

#### **Pests**

> ####  Climate change causes spread of forest and crop pests and diseases, ***and biodiversity*** with native and diverse species in place of non-native, monocultured plantations can decrease prevalence of pests and diseases.

<br/>

<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_wildfire.png" alt="wildfire icon"/></div>

#### **Wildfires**

> ####  Climate change causes more extreme wildfires, ***and biodiversity*** with diverse forests in genes and species can spread risk, increase resistance to stresses, and promote resilience to forest systems.

<br/>

<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_factory.png" alt="factory icon"/></div>

#### **Emissions**

> ####  Climate change mostly derives from emitting carbon emissions into atmosphere, ***and biodiversity*** with healthy forests, wetlands, mangroves, seagrass, and other biomes can naturally capture and sequester carbon.

#### Why _And Biodiversity_? To underscore its importance:

<br/>


<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_economy.png" alt="economy icon"/></div>

#### **Economy**

> #### Modern economies often measure the accumulation of produced capital (roads, machines, buildings, factories, and ports) and human capital (health and education) but overlook the essential natural capital ***and biodiversity*** provides such value from raw materials to regulation of resources and environment (air, food, water, climate) to support commerce and livelihoods.

<br/>

<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_society.png" alt="society icon"/></div>

#### **Society**

> #### A society free from conflict, inequality, and uncertainty requires a stable climate and healthy ecosystems for basic amenities, occupations, and recreation,  ***and biodiversity*** supports such requirements through functioning carbon, nitrogen, and water cycles and habitat maintenance.

<br/>


<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_culture.png" alt="culture icon"/></div>

#### **Culture**

> #### Since dawn of human civilization, species and ecosystems have been integral in culture including languages, arts, foods, customs, beliefs, and values ***and biodiversity*** (akin to human diversity) serves as this living library and heritage.

<br/>

<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_hospital.png" alt="hospital icon"/></div>

#### **Health**

> ####  Physical, mental, and social health and well-being require a stable climate and healthy ecosystems ***and biodiversity*** serves these needs with air, water, and food quality; medicinal supply; hazard and disease protection; recreation and inspiration.

<br/>

<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_watertower.png" alt="water tower icon"/></div>

#### **Infrastructure**

> ####  Robust critical infrastructure of water, energy, food, and commodity supply requires vital inputs ***and biodiversity*** provides water flow and quantity; food pollination and seed dispersal; and natural resources such as fiber, fuel, and timber.

<br/>

<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_survival.png" alt="survival icon"/></div>

#### **Survival**

> ####  Essential human survival needs of air, water, food, and shelter requires a stable cimate and healthy ecosystems ***and biodiversity*** provides such habital existence for humans and many other species.

  <div class="accordion-content">
  <p>Though the issue lacks mainstream media attention, biodiversity loss has been an enduring subject matter in the ecological and environment science literature since the 1970s. It is widely accepted in science with enough impetus to establish a UN convention in 1992 for global initiatives on the issue and intergovernmental science body in 2012 to assess the current knowledge on the topic for policymakers.</p></br>
  <p>_See_ [**Reports**](reports.html) that includes three global assessments across the decades (1995, 2005, and 2019) each with stark findings of rapid biodiversity loss due to human activities.</p>
