#### From the opening of their joint workshop report, selected IPBES and IPCC authors, stated<br/>(emphasis added):

> #### Climate change ***and biodiversity loss*** are two of the most pressing issues of the Anthropocene.

<br/>

#### This information site, _And Biodiversity_, aims to serve as a resource to study the latter crisis which often runs silent, invisible, and in the background to the general public. 

#### For any explanation, citation, or justification regarding ***biodiversity loss***, bookmark this site and return to review the topic, major reports, figures, quotes, and resources.

#### Why _And Biodiversity_? To hopefully mainstream the issue across institutions:

<br/>

<div class="stick_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_media.png" alt="media person icon"/></div>

#### **Media**

> #### "We continue to provide the latest on our series on Climate Change ***and Biodiversity Loss***."

<br/>

<div class="stick_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_politician.png" alt="politician icon"/></div>

#### **Politics**

> #### "Climate change ***and biodiversity loss*** are existential threats and are on the ballot this election."

<br/>

<div class="stick_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_business.png" alt="business icon"/></div>

#### **Business**

> #### "We forecast in next quarter into next few fiscal years losses due to climate change ***and biodiversity loss***."

<br/>

<div class="stick_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_school.png" alt="school icon"/></div>

#### **Education**

> #### "Class, we will continue our lesson on issues very important to the Earth: climate change ***and biodiversity loss***."

<br/>

<div class="stick_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_protesters.png" alt="protester icon"/></div>

#### **Activism**

> #### "Save our planet from the Climate Crisis ***and Biodiversity Crisis!***"

<br/>

<div class="stick_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_talking.png" alt="people talking icon"/></div>

#### **Civil Society**

> #### "You know I'm really starting to worry about climate change ***and biodiversity loss***."

#### Why _And Biodiversity_? To raise awareness of nature-based solutions:

<br/>


<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_heatwave.png" alt="heatwave icon"/></div>

#### **Heatwaves**

> #### Climate change causes prolonged and intense heatwaves, ***and biodiversity*** with transpiration of trees and plants can bring a coolness and reduce urban heat island effects.

<br/>


<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_flood.png" alt="flooding icon"/></div>

#### **Flooding**

> #### Climate change causes more extreme weather events, ***and biodiversity*** with healthy rivers, wetlands, and coral reefs across coastlines and floodplains can absorb and buffer storm surges and flooding.

<br/>

<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_crops.png" alt="crops icon"/></div>

#### **Famine**

> #### Climate change causes more crop yields to decline, ***and biodiversity*** with rich soil organisms can regulate and regenerate soil health and with diverse crops and livestock can stabilize food supply. 

<br/>


<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_waterlevel.png" alt="low water icon"/></div>

#### **Drought**

> #### Climate change causes more widespread droughts, ***and biodiversity*** with healthy freshwater ecosystems can regulate water quality, flow, supply, and enhance groundwater systems.

<br/>

<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_pests.png" alt="pests icon"/></div>

#### **Pests**

> ####  Climate change causes spread of forest and crop pests and diseases, ***and biodiversity*** with native and diverse species in place of non-native, monocultured plantations can decrease prevalence of pests and diseases.

<br/>

<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_wildfire.png" alt="wildfire icon"/></div>

#### **Wildfires**

> ####  Climate change causes more extreme wildfires, ***and biodiversity*** with diverse forests in genes and species can spread risk, increase resistance to stresses, and promote resilience to forest systems.

<br/>

<div class="climate_image"><img src="images/stick_figure_factory.png" alt="factory icon"/></div>

#### **Emissions**

> ####  Climate change mostly derives from emitting carbon emissions into atmosphere, ***and biodiversity*** with healthy forests, wetlands, mangroves, seagrass, and other biomes can naturally capture and sequester carbon.

#### Why _And Biodiversity_? To dispel common misunderstandings:

<br/>

- #### <a href="####" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#mis1">Biodiversity loss is not as immediate an issue as climate change.</a>

  <div id="mis1" class="collapse">  

  #### Although the media and general public overlook biodiversity loss for various reasons, scientists have consistently asserted the devastating consequences of continued loss of biodiversity which is accelerating at unprecedented levels in human history. 
  
  #### Such loss negatively impacts ecosystem services such as life-critical needs of food production, soil formation, water availability, air quality, climate regulation, medicines, and still others. _See_ [**Reports**](figures.html) for discussion of this crisis over the last 50 years.

- #### <a href="####" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#mis2">Climate change encompasses biodiversity loss and other environment issues.</a> 

  <div id="mis2" class="collapse">  

  #### Owing to its popularity over the years, climate change has become synonymous with all environment or green issues and therefore encompasses all ecological crises. In reality, climate change is only one issue under the umbrella of nature crises. 
  
  #### In fact, climate is just one of several planetary boundaries of the Earth System which includes biodiversity, ozone, freshwater, land use, nitrogen and phosophorus cycle, chemicals, and others. _See_ [**Figures**](figures.html) for other diagrams of planetary boundaries.

- #### <a href="####" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#mis3">Biodiversity loss is a fairly new topic and not as widely accepted.</a>

  <div id="mis3" class="collapse">  

  #### Though it lacks mainstream media attention, biodiversity loss has been an enduring subject matter in the ecological and environment science literature since the 1970s. It is widely accepted in science with enough impetus to establish a UN convention in 1992 for global initiatives on the issue and intergovernmental science body in 2012 to assess the current knowledge on the topic for policymakers. 
  
  #### _See_ [**Reports**](reports.html) that includes three global assessments across the decades (1995, 2005, and 2019) each with stark findings of rapid biodiversity loss due to human activities.

- #### <a href="####" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#mis4">Climate change causes biodiversity loss, so are the same thing.</a>

  <div id="mis4" class="collapse">  

  #### While the two crises share mutually reinforcing and overlapping causes and effects, the scientific evidence over decades demonstrates both crises are distinct issues and should not be conflated without acknowledgment of their unique and shared qualities. Consequently, the approach to solve one may negatively or positively affect the other. 

  #### _See_ [**Figures**](figures.html) that show graphics of overlap, trade-offs, and synergies between the two planetary emergencies.

  <div id="mis5" class="collapse">  

  #### While species extinctions and ecosystem shifts are natural processes on Earth including five known mass extinction events, the present situation of biodiversity loss exceeds the natural occurrence in geological timescales. Also, unlike past events, the current rapid loss of biodiversity and ecosystems is mostly due to a single species aware of their actions. 
  
  #### _See_ [**Quotes**](quotes.html) which includes the finding from IPBES's 2019 Global Assessment: the rate of extinction is ten to hundreds of times higher than the average background rate in the last 10 million years and is accelerating.

- #### <a href="####" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#mis6">Biodiversity loss would not be hardly known if it is so important.</a>

  <div id="mis6" class="collapse">  

  #### Biodiversity coverage in the media has been a challenge for decades and in turn causes a lack of awareness among the general public. Studies ([IIED (2008)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep01416#metadata_info_tab_contents){target="_blank"} and [Legagneux, et al. (2018)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2017.00175/full){target="_blank"}) have discussed the under-reported media coverage of biodiversity loss compared to climate change. As an unfortunate result, only experts tend to know about this planetary crisis. 
  
  #### Even Sir Robert Watson, who either chaired or co-chaired all three global biodiversity assessments acknowledge in a [Guardian op-ed](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/19/biodiversity-touches-every-aspect-of-our-lives-so-why-has-its-loss-been-ignored){target="_blank"} how much biodiversity has been ignored despite its severity and critical importance.
