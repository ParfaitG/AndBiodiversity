  <div class="accordion-content">
  <p>**What is biodiversity loss?**<br/>The rapid, accelerating loss of variability and abundance of life on Earth including plant and animal species, populations, wild and domesticated varieties, and natural habitats recently caused by human activities with direct drivers of land/sea use change, overexploitation of organisms, climate change, pollution, and invasive alien species. _See_ IPBES 2019 Global Assessment.</p>

  <label class="accordion-label" for="check2">Who?</label>
  <div class="accordion-content">
  <p>**Who are affected by biodiversity loss?**<br/>Due to reliance on biodiversity for feed, fiber, fuel, air, water, climate, medicines, hazard protection, and other ecosystem services, all flora and fauna including humans are affected by this crisis. _See_ IPBES-IPCC co-sponsored 2021 report.</p>

  <label class="accordion-label" for="check3">Where</label>
  <div class="accordion-content">
  <p>**Where does biodiversity loss occur?**<br/>While disappearing species and damaged ecosystems vary by regions and biomes, consistent evidence indicates a global scale to biodiversity loss. _See_ World Wildlife Fund's Living Planet biennual reports.</p>

  <label class="accordion-label" for="check4">When</label>
  <div class="accordion-content">
  <p>**When did biodiversity loss start?**<br/>Since the Industrial Age and notably mid-20th century with the rapid rise of human population, global trade, industrial farming and fishing, expansive urbanization, biodiversity loss has occurred at unprecedented levels in human history with signs of acceleration. _See_ all biodiversity global assessments from 1995, 2005, and 2019.</p>

  <input type="radio" name="radio-a" id="check5">
  <label class="accordion-label" for="check5">Why</label>
  <div class="accordion-content">
  <p>**Why is biodiversity loss important?**<br/>For life-critical services, environmental, economic, ethical, security, and moral issues, biodiversity loss plays an instrumental role from food webs to GDP accounting. _See_ the Dasgupta Review in 2021 on The Economics of Biodiversity.</p>

  <label class="accordion-label" for="check6">How</label>
  <div class="accordion-content">
  <p>**How can we stop biodiversity loss?**<br/>Raise awareness. Start discussions. Adjust lifestyle and diet. Change behaviors. Avoid waste and excessive consumption. Accept changes in standard of living. Boycott goods, services, and industries that destroy nature. Advocate the end to forest logging, wetland draining, and other actions. Implore public and business leaders. Exercise consumer and voting power. Insist on sustainable spatial planning with nature. _See_ recommendations in most reports and papers.</p>
