driver of the global <strong><em>biodiversity crisis</em></strong> and a
vital opportunity to address it…Economic and political decisions have
predominantly prioritised certain values of nature, particularly
market-based instrumental values of nature, such as those associated
with food produced intensively. Although often privileged in
policymaking, these market values do not adequately reflect how changes
in nature affect people’s quality of life. Furthermore, policymaking
overlooks the many non-market values associated with nature’s
contributions to people, such as climate regulation and cultural

crises and moving towards sustainable economies. Three interrelated
pathways involving forests and trees can support economic and
environmental recovery. These are (1) halting deforestation and
maintaining forests; (2) restoring degraded lands and expanding
agroforestry; and (3) sustainably using forests and building green value
chains. <a href="https://www.fao.org/publications/sofo/2022/en/"

amount of marine litter and plastic pollution has been growing rapidly.
Emissions of plastic waste into aquatic ecosystems are projected to
nearly triple by 2040 without meaningful action. Marine litter and
plastics present a serious threat to all marine life, while also
influencing the climate. Plastics are the largest, most harmful and most
persistent fraction of marine litter, accounting for at least 85 per
cent of total marine waste…Plastics can also alter global carbon cycling
through their effect on plankton and primary production in marine,
freshwater and terrestrial systems. Marine ecosystems, especially
mangroves, seagrasses, corals and salt marshes, play a major role in
sequestering carbon. The more damage we do to oceans and coastal areas,
the harder it is for these ecosystems to both offset and remain
resilient to climate change.<a

realisation that fungi are closer to animals than plants is, however,
only one of a number of remarkable facts to emerge in the past few
decades. It is now becoming apparent that these organisms, which often
cannot be seen with the naked eye and spend vast parts of their life
cycle underground or inside plants and animals, are responsible for
incredibly important processes; these include global cycling of
nutrients, carbon sequestration, and even the prevention of
desertification in some drought-prone regions of the world. Fungi also
underpin products and processes that we rely heavily on in aspects of
everyday life, from critical drugs (including statins, the class of
medication used to lower blood cholesterol), to synthesis of biofuels,
to cleaning up the environment through bioremediation. Some have
multiple uses; for example, species of Penicillium have uses as diverse
as in antibiotics, the synthesis of third-generation contraceptive pills
and cheese production. The global market in edible mushrooms is also
huge and increasing. <a

nearly 90 per cent of wild flowering plant species depend, at least in
part, on the transfer of pollen by animals. These plants are critical
for the continued functioning of ecosystems as they provide food, form
habitats and provide other resources for a wide range of other
species…The vast majority of pollinator species are wild, including more
than 20,000 species of bees, some species of flies, butterflies, moths,
wasps, beetles, thrips, birds, bats and other vertebrates…Wild
pollinators have declined in occurrence and diversity (and abundance for
certain species) at local and regional scales in North West Europe and
North America…Threats include land-use change, intensive agricultural
management and pesticide use, environmental pollution, invasive alien
species, pathogens and climate change. <a

Anthropocene is uncertain; in fact several indicators give cause for
alarm. The Living Planet Index, which measures
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> abundance levels based on 14,152
monitored populations of 3,706 vertebrate species, shows a persistent
downward trend. On average, monitored species population abundance
declined by 58 per cent between 1970 and 2012. Monitored species are
increasingly affected by pressures from unsustainable agriculture,
fisheries, mining and other human activities that contribute to habitat
loss and degradation, overexploitation, climate change and pollution. In
a business-as-usual scenario, this downward trend in species populations
continues into the future. <a

as conserving at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water

not be sufficient to achieve the targets set for 2020, and additional
action is required to keep the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020
on course. Key potential actions for accelerating progress towards each
target are listed below. Extrapolations for a range of indicators
suggest that based on current trends, pressures on

the Anthropocene, based on evidence that atmospheric, geological,
hydrological, biological and other Earth System processes are being
altered by human activity. The most readily recognized changes include a
rise in global temperatures and sea levels, and ocean acidification, all
associated with the increase in emissions of greenhouse gases,
especially carbon dioxide and methane (Chapters 2 and 4). Other
human-induced changes include extensive deforestation and land clearance
for agriculture and urbanization, causing species extinctions as natural

since IPCC AR4 has served to strengthen the conclusion that
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> is important in mitigating
climate change. This importance stems from the role of ecosystems in the
carbon cycle. Ecosystems sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
and then store it. Human-induced changes in those ecosystems can lead
either to increased sequestration of carbon dioxide or to increased
emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Promoting the
former type of change and reducing the latter type of change can make a
very significant contribution to climate change mitigation. The use of
ecosystem-based mitigation policies can also contribute to sustaining a

aim of this study is to explore policy options that could have major

The main question is whether the 2010 Biodiversity Target can be met at
global and regional levels. Effects up to 2050 are taken into account.
According to a business as usual scenario (baseline), and six individual
options, it is unlikely that the 2010 target will be met at either
global level or regional level. The loss of
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> is expected to continue at an
unchanged pace in the coming decades. Key drivers, global population and
economic activity are expected to keep on growing. Between 2000 and
2050, the global population is projected to grow by 50% and the global
economy to quadruple. The need for food, fodder, energy and wood will
unavoidably lead to a decrease in the global natural stocks. The
negative impact of climate change, nitrogen deposition, fragmentation,
infrastructure and unchecked human settlement on
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> will further expand. <a

<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> is being lost at a rate many
times higher than that of natural extinction due to land conversion,
climate change, pollution, unsustainable harvesting of natural resources
and the introduction of exotic species. Land conversion is most
intensive in tropical forests and less intensive in temperate, boreal
and arctic regions; atmospheric nitrogen deposition is largest in
northern temperate areas close to cities; introduction of exotic species
is related to patterns of human activity. Human population growth
together with unsustainable patterns of consumption, increasing
production of waste and pollutants, urban development and international

additional pressure and have already begun to affect

is clear that even if the above-mentioned numbers should be regarded as
only crude estimates, current extinction rates are dramatically higher
than background extinction rates. For every species that goes extinct,
many populations have become extinct (termed local extinction or
extirpation)…Causes of extinction, i.e. those factors that make
populations vulnerable to extinction in the first place, include habitat
degradation (loss, change in quality and fragmentation),
over-exploitation and persecution, and introductions of alien
species…The rich complexity of both the physical environment and the
interactions among organisms and species appears to be crucial for the
maintenance and generation of <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>.
Thus, the ecosystem and its component communities appear to be very
appropriate targets for conservation, because they take into account
explicitly the many ecological interactions between organisms and their
biotic and abiotic natural environment. A space-orientated approach up
to the landscape scale may be the most appropriate tool with which to
conserve the vast majority of <strong><em>biological

nunber of species and the amount of genetic variation within individual

far-reaching repercussions for humanity. <strong><em>Biological
diversity</em></strong> must be seen as a global resource, like the
atmosphere or the oceans. All nations have a common interest in it and
all have a common responsibility towards it. Despite such action as has
already been taken to promote conservation, there is a pressing need for

the “environment” is where we all live; and “development” is what we all
do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are
inseparable. Further, development issues must be seen as crucial by the
political leaders who feel that their countries have reached a plateau
towards which other nations must strive. Many of the development paths
of the industrialized nations are clearly unsustainable. And the
development decisions of these countries, because of their great
economic and political power, will have a profound effect upon the
ability of all peoples to sustain human progress for generations to
come. Many critical survival issues are related to uneven development,
poverty, and population growth. They all place unprecedented pressures
on the planet’s lands, waters, forests, and other natural resources, not
least in the developing countries. The downward spiral of poverty and
environmental degradation is a waste of opportunities and of resources.
In particular, it is a waste of human resources. These links between
poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation formed a major theme
in our analysis and recommendations. What is needed now is a new era of
economic growth - growth that is forceful and at the same time socially
and environmentally sustainable. <a

condition of the physical environment, so obviously a focus of emphasis
in the years leading up to Stockholm, has become of lesser concern to
those commissioning these reviews. As the chapters of the present volume
reveal, this shift of emphasis does not mean that there have not been
significant changes in the physical environment. Carbon dioxide
concentrations in the atmosphere continued to rise, concern about acid
rains grew, and fears about man’s impact on stratospheric ozone
remained. The pollution of the oceans and inland waters and the loss of
soil and of productivity through erosion, desertification and salinity,
were at the forefront of attention. The depletion of <strong><em>genetic
resources</em></strong>, especially in the tropical forests, was much
debated. The volume and number of manufactured chemicals reaching the
environment increased enormously. <a

and water are important requirements for food production. As the need to
increase food production becomes more urgent, man is faced with
continued loss of productive soil through desertification, erosion,
salination and other forms of destructive land use…Overlogging of
tropical forests has had similar effects. It is estimated that already
man’s activities have despoiled some 10 per cent of the world’s arable
land. In addition, good agricultural land is coming under intense
pressure, in both developed and developing countries, from urban uses.
There is still land available which can be brought under cultivation,
but as larger and larger areas are given over to farming, the
unexploited tracts available to serve as reservoirs of
<strong><em>species diversity</em></strong> and natural ecosystems
become smaller and smaller. <a

is both creature and moulder of his environment, which gives him
physical sustenance and affords him the opportunity for intellectual,
moral, social and spiritual growth. In the long and tortuous evolution
of the human race on this planet a stage has been reached when, through
the rapid acceleration of science and technology, man has acquired the
power to transform his environment in countless ways and on an
unprecedented scale. Both aspects of man’s environment, the natural and
the man-made, are essential to his well-being and to the enjoyment of
basic human rights-even the right to life itself…A point has been
reached in history when we must shape our actions throughout the world
with a more prudent care for their environmental consequences. Through
ignorance or indifference we can do massive and irreversible harm to the
earthly environment on which our life and well-being depend. <a

the discussions held by the General Assembly at its twenty-third session
it was emphasized that for the first time in the history of mankind,
there is arising a crisis of world-wide proportions involving developed
and developing countries alike -the crisis of the human environment.
Portents of this crisis have long been apparent- in the explosive growth
of human populations, in the poor integration of a powerful and
efficient technology with environmental requirements, in the
deterioration of agricultural lands, in the unplanned extension of urban
areas, in the decrease of available space and the growing danger of
extinction of many forms of animal and plant life. It is becoming
apparent that if current trends continue, the future of life on earth
could be endangered. It is urgent, therefore, to focus world attention
on those problems which threaten humanity in an environment that permits
the realization of the highest human aspirations, and on the action
necessary to deal with them. <a

emphasis has been put on work programmes concerned with pollution of the
human environment, this being an aspect of the subject-matter outlined
in the Swedish memornndum which has up to the present time concerned
United Nations organizations and prograrmues more than others. Pollution
of the environment, air, water and soiil, from different sources, is
dealt with by the ILO, FAO, UNESCO, WHO, WMO, IAEA and, on the regional
level, ECE. Pollution of the sea caused by ships is the concern of IMCO.
Pollution caused by radiation is the concern of IAEA, UNSCEAR, WHO and
FAO. The proper and rational use of land, including problems of soil
erosion, soil conservation and the establishment and protection of
forests, is being studied particularly by FAO. <a
