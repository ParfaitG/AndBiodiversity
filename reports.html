sufficient finance, nature-based solutions (NbS) provide the means to
cost-effectively reach climate, <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>
and land degradation neutrality targets, particularly if investments
simultaneously contribute to <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>,
climate and restoration targets. This “double” or “triple” win potential
is particularly alluring given the current economic situation…Delayed
action is no longer an option in the face of the devastating effects of
climate change, the extinction crisis and severe land degradation
globally. Politicians, business and finance leaders and citizens
globally must transform their relationship with nature to work with it
rather than against it…Private sector investment in NbS must increase by
several orders of magnitude in the coming years…Nature-negative
expenditures far outweigh investments in nature-based solutions…It is
critical to rapidly align policies, regulation, economic activity and
financial flows with <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> values and
with the Paris Agreement. <a

planet is out of breath as a result of our unsustainable consumption and
production patterns – fueling the fires of <strong><em>biodiversity
loss</em></strong>, pollution and climate change. Urgent action to
conserve and restore the environment is needed, providing a healthier
climate for people and planet. Outdoor sport connects us with the health
of our bodies as well as that of our natural world– from the air we
breathe, to the climate we train in; from the landscape we move through,
to the quality of food we use to fuel our bodies. Sport is both deeply
dependent and connected to nature – and thus it brings us together by
reminding us that everyone has a role to play in contributing to a
playing field that is in harmony with nature. <a

we face the double, interlinked emergencies of human-induced climate
change and the <strong><em>loss of biodiversity</em></strong>,
threatening the well-being of current and future generations. As our
future is critically dependent on <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>
and a stable climate, it is essential that we understand how nature’s
decline and climate change are connected…Land-use change is still the
biggest current threat to nature, destroying or fragmenting the natural
habitats of many plant and animal species on land, in freshwater and in
the sea. However, if we are unable to limit warming to 1.5°C, climate
change is likely to become the dominant cause of
<strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> in the coming decades. <a

widely distributed, relatively easy to survey, and responsive to
environmental change, birds are useful
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> indicators, revealing wider
trends in natural ecosystems…One in eight bird species is threatened
with extinction, and the status of the world’s birds continues to
deteriorate: species are moving ever faster towards extinction. For
those not yet considered threatened, the majority are in decline and
have much-depleted populations. The pressures causing these losses of
our natural heritage are well understood, and the vast majority are
driven by human actions. The principal threats include: agricultural
expansion and intensification, unsustainable logging, invasive alien
species, overexploitation and climate change…Most species are impacted
by combinations of these threats, and some threats exacerbate others. <a

way nature is valued in political and economic decisions is both a key
driver of the global <strong><em>biodiversity crisis</em></strong> and a
vital opportunity to address it…Economic and political decisions have
predominantly prioritised certain values of nature, particularly
market-based instrumental values of nature, such as those associated
with food produced intensively. Although often privileged in
policymaking, these market values do not adequately reflect how changes
in nature affect people’s quality of life. Furthermore, policymaking
overlooks the many non-market values associated with nature’s
contributions to people, such as climate regulation and cultural

extent that the disruption of the natural nitrogen cycle is now one of
the greatest global threats to the environment of the 21st century. Key
N threats include: reductions in <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>

the production of nitrous oxide gas (N2O); widespread air pollution
leading to growing incidences of upper respiratory disease and cancer in
humans; depletion of stratospheric ozone layer via the production of

amount of marine litter and plastic pollution has been growing rapidly.
Emissions of plastic waste into aquatic ecosystems are projected to
nearly triple by 2040 without meaningful action. Marine litter and
plastics present a serious threat to all marine life, while also
influencing the climate. Plastics are the largest, most harmful and most
persistent fraction of marine litter, accounting for at least 85 per
cent of total marine waste…Plastics can also alter global carbon cycling
through their effect on plankton and primary production in marine,
freshwater and terrestrial systems. Marine ecosystems, especially
mangroves, seagrasses, corals and salt marshes, play a major role in
sequestering carbon. The more damage we do to oceans and coastal areas,
the harder it is for these ecosystems to both offset and remain
resilient to climate change. <a

degradation and careless wildlife trade both increase the risks of
pandemics, with up to three quarters of new diseases being zoonotic in
origin. Meanwhile, water-borne diseases ‘like infant diarrhoea’ are
increased by poor wetland management and cause millions of deaths every
year. Control of emergent zoonotic diseases is increasingly seen as
dependent on maintenance of well-managed, intact ecosystems and native
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>. Deterioration of wetlands is
widespread, but more wetlands are still reported as in ‘good’ rather
than ‘bad’ ecological character. <strong><em>Biodiversity
losses</em></strong> are linked to land-use change and still rising.
Wetlands are particularly impacted by sea-level rise, coral bleaching
and changing hydrology, with Arctic and montane wetlands especially at
risk. Wetlands need to be part of delivering climate solutions. <a

environmental challenges have grown in number and severity ever since
the Stockholm Conference in 1972 and now represent a planetary
emergency…Over the last 50 years, the global economy has grown nearly
fivefold, due largely to a tripling in extraction of natural resources
and energy that has fuelled growth in production and consumption. The
world population has increased by a factor of two, to 7.8 billion
people, and though on average prosperity has also doubled, about 1.3
billion people remain poor and some 700 million are hungry. The
increasingly unequal and resource-intensive model of development drives
environmental decline through climate change, <strong><em>biodiversity
loss</em></strong> and other forms of pollution and resource
degradation. <a

are facing a global crisis. We are totally dependent upon the natural
world. It supplies us with every oxygen-laden breath we take and every
mouthful of food we eat. But we are currently damaging it so profoundly
that many of its natural systems are now on the verge of
breakdown…Nature is more than a mere economic good. Nature nurtures and
nourishes us, so we will think of assets as durable entities that not
only have use value, but may also have intrinsic worth. Once we make
that extension, the economics of <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>
becomes a study in portfolio management…But in addition to mobility,
Nature has two properties that make the economics of
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> markedly different from the
economics that informs our intuitions about the character of produced
capital. Many of the processes that shape our natural world are

global Living Planet Index continues to decline. It shows an average 68%
decrease in population sizes of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and
fish between 1970 and 2016. A 94% decline in the LPI for the tropical
subregions of the Americas is the largest fall observed in any part of
the world. Why does this matter? It matters because
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> is fundamental to human life on
Earth, and the evidence is unequivocal – it is being destroyed by us at
a rate unprecedented in history. Since the industrial revolution, human
activities have increasingly destroyed and degraded forests, grasslands,
wetlands and other important ecosystems, threatening human well-being.

91 billion per year (2015-2017 average). Meanwhile, governments spend
approximately USD 500 billion per year in support that is potentially
harmful to <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> i.e. five to six times
more than total spending for <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>. The
total volume of finance flows that are harmful to
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> (i.e. encompassing all public and

initiatives are underway to improve the assessment, tracking and
reporting of <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> finance flows.
Nevertheless, data gaps and inconsistencies persist. To address this

estimate that 11 million metric tons of plastic entered the ocean from
land in 2016, adding to the estimated 150 million metric tons of plastic
already in the ocean. Plastic flows into the ocean are projected to
nearly triple by 2040 to 29 million metric tons per year. Even worse,
because plastic remains in the ocean for hundreds of years, or longer,
and may never biodegrade, the cumulative amount of plastic stock in the
ocean could grow by 450 million metric tons in the next 20 years— with
severe impacts on <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>, and ocean and
human health…From coral reefs to deep sea trenches and from remote
islands to the poles, plastic alters habitats, harms wildlife, and can
damage ecosystem function and services. More than 800 species are
already known to be affected by marine plastic pollution, including all
sea turtle species, more than 40 per cent of cetacean species, and 44
per cent of marine bird species. <a

2020 edition of The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture continues
to demonstrate the significant and growing role of fisheries and
aquaculture in providing food, nutrition and employment. It also shows
the major challenges ahead despite the progress made on a number of
fronts. For example, there is growing evidence that when fisheries are
properly managed, stocks are consistently above target levels or
rebuilding, giving credibility to the fishery managers and governments
around the world that are willing to take strong action. However, the
report also demonstrates that the successes achieved in some countries
and regions have not been sufficient to reverse the global trend of
overfished stocks, indicating that in places where fisheries management
is not in place, or is ineffective, the status of fish stocks is poor
and deteriorating. This unequal progress highlights the urgent need to
replicate and re-adapt successful policies and measures in the light of
the realities and needs of specific fisheries. It calls for new
mechanisms to support the effective implementation of policy and
management reg ulations for sustainable fisheries and ecosystems, as the
only solution to ensure fisheries around the world are sustainable. <a

are an important source of both ecosystem services and ecosystem
disservices. Recent studies have indicated a worrying decline in insect
species, especially in flying insects in the northern temperate region,
and this has spawned much media attention. Some decline has occurred, it
is clear, due to agricultural intensification, urbanization, overuse of
pesticides, and global climate change. A decline would seriously affect
the ecosystem services that insects provide. However, there is too
little data to warrant the belief that all insects are declining
everywhere. There is a pressing need for more basic research on insect
diversity in the context of a changing world. <a

degradation continue to take place at alarming rates, which contributes
significantly to the ongoing <strong><em>loss of

million hectares of forest have been lost through conversion to other
land uses, although the rate of deforestation has decreased over the

key components of <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> for food and

Evidence suggests that the proportion of livestock breeds at risk of
extinction is increasing, and that, for some crops and in some areas,
plant diversity in farmers’ fields is decreasing and threats to
diversity are increasing. Nearly a third of fish stocks are overfished
and a third of freshwater fish species assessed are considered
threatened. Countries report that many species that contribute to vital
ecosystem services, including pollinators, natural enemies of pests,
soil organisms and wild food species, are in decline as a consequence of
the destruction and degradation of habitats, overexploitation, pollution
and other threats. Key ecosystems that deliver numerous services
essential to food and agriculture, including supply of freshwater,
protection against hazards and provision of habitat for species such as
fish and pollinators, are declining rapidly. <a

state of marine fishery resources, based on FAO’s monitoring of assessed
marine fish stocks, has continued to decline. The fraction of marine
fish stocks fished within biologically sustainable levels has exhibited
a decreasing trend, from 90.0 percent in 1974 to 66.9 percent in 2015.
In contrast, the percentage of stocks fished at biologically
unsustainable levels increased from 10 percent in 1974 to 33.1 percent
in 2015, with the largest increases in the late 1970s and 1980s. In
2015, maximally sustainably fished stocks (formerly termed fully fished
stocks) accounted for 59.9 percent and underfished stocks for 7.0
percent of the total assessed stocks…The persistence of overfished
stocks is an area of great concern. <a

realisation that fungi are closer to animals than plants is, however,
only one of a number of remarkable facts to emerge in the past few
decades. It is now becoming apparent that these organisms, which often
cannot be seen with the naked eye and spend vast parts of their life
cycle underground or inside plants and animals, are responsible for
incredibly important processes; these include global cycling of
nutrients, carbon sequestration, and even the prevention of
desertification in some drought-prone regions of the world. Fungi also
underpin products and processes that we rely heavily on in aspects of
everyday life, from critical drugs (including statins, the class of
medication used to lower blood cholesterol), to synthesis of biofuels,
to cleaning up the environment through bioremediation. Some have
multiple uses; for example, species of Penicillium have uses as diverse
as in antibiotics, the synthesis of third-generation contraceptive pills
and cheese production. The global market in edible mushrooms is also
huge and increasing. <a

bolstering livelihoods, providing clean air and water, conserving

agriculture and livestock areas, threatens not only the livelihoods of
foresters, forest communities and indigenous peoples, but also the
variety of life on our planet. Land-use changes result in a loss of
valuable habitats, land degradation, soil erosion, a decrease in clean
water, and the release of carbon into the atmosphere. How to increase

Atlas describes soil as habitat for the diversity of organisms that live
under our feet. At the same time, it draws attention to the threats to
soil <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>, such as invasive species,
pollution, intensive land use practices or climate change. The Atlas
provides current solutions for a sustainable management of soils. It was
coordinated by the JRC and the Global Soil Biodiversity Initiative
(www.globalsoilbiodiversity.org) with more than 70 contributing
organisations and several hundred individual contributions. It
illustrates the diversity of soil organisms, explains their geographical
and temporal distribution, the ecosystem functions and services provided
by soil biota. Most importantly, it draws attention to the myriad of
threats to soil <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>. These include
inappropriate land management practices (e.g. deforestation, land take
for infrastructure development), agricultural systems, over-grazing,
forest fires and poor water management (both irrigation and drainage).
Other practices such as land conversion from grassland or forest to
cropped land result in rapid loss of soil carbon, which indirectly
enhances global warming. <a

downward trend. On average, monitored species population abundance
declined by 58 per cent between 1970 and 2012. Monitored species are

millennia after terrestrial food production shifted from hunter-gatherer
activities to agriculture, aquatic food production has transitioned from
being primarily based on capture of wild fish to culture of increasing
numbers of farmed species. A milestone was reached in 2014 when the
aquaculture sector’s contribution to the supply of fish for human
consumption overtook that of wild-caught fish for the first time.
Meeting the ever-growing demand for fish as food in conformity with the
2030 Agenda will be imperative, and also immensely challenging…With
capture fishery production relatively static since the late 1980s,
aquaculture has been responsible for the impressive growth in the supply
of fish for human consumption…Growth in the global supply of fish for
human consumption has outpaced population growth in the past five
decades, increasing at an average annual rate of 3.2 percent in the
period 1961–2013, double that of population growth, resulting in
increasing average per capita availability…Thus, governance needs to
ensure that fisheries and aquaculture adapt to the impacts of climate
change and improve the resilience of food production systems. <a

hectares per year. The greatest net loss of forests and net gain in
agricultural land over the period was in the low-income group of
countries, where rural populations are growing. Large-scale commercial
agriculture accounts for about 40 percent of deforestation in the
tropics and subtropics, local subsistence agriculture for 33 percent,
infrastructure for 10 percent, urban expansion for 10 percent and mining
for 7 percent…Underlying factors affecting forest conversion include
population growth and changing food consumption patterns; agricultural
developments, such as changing markets, technological improvements and
active policy interventions; land-tenure security; and the governance of
land-use change. <a

are fundamental to life on earth.” We know more about soil than ever
before, yet perhaps a smaller percentage of people than at any point in
human history would understand the truth of this statement. The
proportion of human labour devoted to working the soil has steadily
decreased through the past century, and hence the experience of direct
contact with the soil has lessened in most regions. Soil is very
different in this regard from food, energy, water and air, to which each
of us requires constant and secure access. Yet human society as a whole
depends more than ever before on products from the soil as well as on
the more intangible services it provides for maintenance of the

last 50 years have seen unprecedented improvements in human health, as
measured by most conventional metrics. This human flourishing has,
however, been at the cost of extensive degradation to the Earth’s
ecological and biogeochemical systems. The impacts of transformations to
these systems; including accelerating climatic disruption, land
degradation, growing water scarcity, fisheries degradation, pollution,
and <strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong>; have already begun to
negatively impact human health. Left unchecked these changes threaten to
reverse the global health gains of the last several decades and will
likely become the dominant threat to health over the next century. <a

has been significant progress towards meeting some components of the

as conserving at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water
areas, are on track to be met. However, in most cases this progress will
not be sufficient to achieve the targets set for 2020, and additional
action is required to keep the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011–2020
on course. Key potential actions for accelerating progress towards each
target are listed below. Extrapolations for a range of indicators
suggest that based on current trends, pressures on
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> will continue to increase at
least until 2020, and that the status of
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> will continue to decline. This is
despite the fact that society’s responses to the <strong><em>loss of

the remainder of this decade. <a href="https://www.cbd.int/gbo4/"

the Earth System – which acts as a single, self-regulating system

effects of human activities can be detected at a planetary scale. These
have led scientists to define a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene,
based on evidence that atmospheric, geological, hydrological, biological
and other Earth System processes are being altered by human activity.
The most readily recognized changes include a rise in global
temperatures and sea levels, and ocean acidification, all associated
with the increase in emissions of greenhouse gases, especially carbon
dioxide and methane. Other human-induced changes include extensive
deforestation and land clearance for agriculture and urbanization,
causing species extinctions as natural habitats are destroyed. <a

and ecosystems deliver crucial services to humankind – from food
security to keeping our waters clean, buffering against extreme weather,
providing medicines to recreation and adding to the foundation of human
culture. Together these services have been estimated to be worth over
21–72 trillion USD every year – comparable to the World Gross National
Income of 58 trillion USD in 2008. Human society is however living well
beyond the carrying capacity of the planet and currently over 60% of

Arctic habitats for flora and fauna, including sea ice, tundra,
thermokarst ponds and lakes, and permafrost peatlands have been
disappearing over recent decades. Although the majority of Arctic
species examined in this report are currently stable or increasing, some
species of importance to Arctic people or species of global significance
are declining. Climate change is emerging as the most far reaching and
significant stressor on Arctic <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>.
However, contaminants, habitat fragmentation, industrial development,
and unsustainable harvest levels continue to have impacts. Complex
interactions between climate change and other factors have the potential
to magnify impacts on <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>. <a

loss</em></strong> and climate change are two of the most pressing
challenges of our time. Soil <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> is
part of the solution to both. The main goal of the atlas is to inform
the general public, policy makers, land managers, teachers and the
general scientific community of the unique characteristics of life in
soil and raise awareness of its environmental importance and global
significance. Soil contains at least one quarter to one third of all
living organisms on the planet yet only around 1% of soil microorganisms
have been identified compared to 80% of plants. Most terrestrial
ecosystem processes that sustain life on the planet (e.g. soil
fertility, nutrient cycles, greenhouse gas fluxes, pollution control,
antibiotics) are in fact all driven by soil biology. However, life
within the soil is complex to observe (i.e. small scale and mostly
hidden away) and suffers greatly by being ‘out of sight and out of
mind’. <a

since IPCC AR4 has served to strengthen the conclusion that
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> is important in mitigating
climate change. This importance stems from the role of ecosystems in the
carbon cycle. Ecosystems sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
and then store it. Human-induced changes in those ecosystems can lead
either to increased sequestration of carbon dioxide or to increased
emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Promoting the
former type of change and reducing the latter type of change can make a
very significant contribution to climate change mitigation. The use of
ecosystem-based mitigation policies can also contribute to sustaining a
variety of ecosystem services including

change may initially have small positive effects for a few developed

scenarios…Policies on climate change can also help to achieve other
objectives. These co-benefits can significantly reduce the overall cost
to the economy of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. If climate policy
is designed well, it can, for example, contribute to reducing ill-health

aim of this study is to explore policy options that could have major
positive or negative impacts on <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>.
The main question is whether the 2010 Biodiversity Target can be met at
global and regional levels. Effects up to 2050 are taken into account.
According to a business as usual scenario (baseline), and six individual
options, it is unlikely that the 2010 target will be met at either
global level or regional level. The loss of
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> is expected to continue at an
unchanged pace in the coming decades. Key drivers, global population and
economic activity are expected to keep on growing. Between 2000 and
2050, the global population is projected to grow by 50% and the global
economy to quadruple. The need for food, fodder, energy and wood will
unavoidably lead to a decrease in the global natural stocks. The
negative impact of climate change, nitrogen deposition, fragmentation,
infrastructure and unchecked human settlement on
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> will further expand. <a

using the Convention’s indicators to survey current trends, the Global

example: (a) Deforestation, mainly through conversion of forests to
agricultural land, continues at an alarmingly high rate… (b) Trends of
some 3,000 wild populations of species show a consistent decline in
average species abundance of about 40% between 1970 and 2000; inland
water species declined by 50%, while marine and terrestrial species both
declined by around 30%… (c) More species are becoming threatened with
extinction. The status of bird species show a continuing deterioration
across all biomes over the last two decades and preliminary findings for
other major groups, such as amphibians and mammals, indicate that the
situation is likely worse than for birds…The threats to

the past 50 years, humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and
extensively than in any comparable period of time in human history,
largely to meet rapidly growing demands for food, fresh water, timber,
fiber, and fuel. This has resulted in a substantial and largely
irreversible <strong><em>loss in the diversity of life</em></strong> on
Earth. The changes that have been made to ecosystems have contributed to
substantial net gains in human well-being and economic development, but
these gains have been achieved at growing costs in the form of the
degradation of many ecosystem services, increased risks of nonlinear
changes, and the exacerbation of poverty for some groups of people.
These problems, unless addressed, will substantially diminish the
benefits that future generations obtain from ecosystems…The challenge of
reversing the degradation of ecosystems while meeting increasing demands
for their services can be partially met under some scenarios that the MA
has considered, but these involve significant changes in policies,
institutions, and practices that are not currently under way. <a

date, the World Bank Group (WBG) is the largest single international
funding source for <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> projects. A
previous review of the full <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>
portfolio, covering the period from 1988 until 1999, showed that the WBG
approved $2.6 billion for more than 200 projects worldwide to promote
conservation and sustainable use of
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> in 85 countries and 10 regional,
multi-country efforts. This update shows that by the end of June 2004
(FY04), the figure for total <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>
investment has risen to $4.7 billion, signifying that the World Bank
remains committed to <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> conservation
as a significant part of its sustainable development
agenda…Nevertheless, <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> —especially
(but not only) in the developing world—still faces many threats, often
from the very development that is designed to improve livelihoods and
address poverty alleviation. A major challenge for the future is thus to
mainstream <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> into government
programs, normal development assistance, and poverty alleviation
programs by promoting positive synergies, while minimizing the negative
impacts to <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> of potentially
damaging investments such as infrastructure development. <a

northern temperate areas close to cities; introduction of exotic species
is related to patterns of human activity. Human population growth
together with unsustainable patterns of consumption, increasing

is often described as the world’s “biggest” industry on the basis of its
contribution to global gross domestic product (GDP), the number of jobs
it generates, and the number of clients it serves. The scale of the
industry and the rate at which it continues to grow present both
opportunities and threats for <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>
conservation. <strong><em>Biodiversity</em></strong> is essential to
human development because of the goods and services it provides. An
estimated 40 percent of the global economy is based on biological
products and processes. However, on a global scale,
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> is being lost at a rate many
times higher than that of natural extinction. This is caused by a number
of factors, including uncontrolled land conversion, climate change,
pollution, unsustainable harvesting of natural resources, and the
introduction of invasive species. So great is the concern over the rate
of decline, and its implications for human welfare, that
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> was identified as one of the five
priority areas for the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development. To
determine priority areas where <strong><em>biodiversity
loss</em></strong> is a serious concern, Conservation International has
identified a series of <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>
“hotspots.” Theese hotspots represent priority areas for urgent
conservation action on a global scale. ey are also useful for looking
at the impact of tourism on <strong><em>biodiversit</em></strong>. <a

diversity of life is the defining feature of planet Earth. It is unique
- as far as we know - in the infinity of the universe. For 11 000 years
since agriculture began, humankind has increasingly appropriated the
biological resources and natural productivity of lands and seas to
support the expansion of civilizations and technologies. Everything that
we have achieved has its origins in living animals, plants and the
communities and ecosystems of which they are a part. But it is only in
the past 30 years, since the United Nations Conference on the Human
Environment in Stockholm in 1972, that we have begun to recognize the
limits to natures gifts. We now know that our own success is placing
strain on nature’s ability to evolve, diversify, cleanse our air and
water and provide us with the raw materials we need for food, fuel,
fiber and health…The reality is that this World Atlas of Biodiversity is
of greater relevance now than at any time in the past. The world’s
living wealth remains the cornerstone of sustainable livelihoods and
quality lifestyles in both the industrialized and developing worlds.
Recognition of this fact is spreading, and the value of
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> in people’s lives, socially,
economically and environmentally, has never been more apparent than it
is today. <a href="https://archive.org/details/worldatlasofbiod02groo"

degradation (including desertification), and air pollution; diversion of
water to intensively managed ecosystems and urban systems; habitat
fragmentation; selective exploitation of species; the introduction of
non-native species; and stratospheric ozone depletion. The current rate
of <strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> is greater than the
natural background rate of extinction. Changes in climate exert
additional pressure and have already begun to affect
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>. Climate change is projected to
affect all aspects of <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>; however,
the projected changes have to take into account the impacts from other

main purpose of this project was to explore where the last remote
wilderness areas, resorts for nature, man and
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> can be found in the Arctic, as
well as the pressures they are subjected to and their main threats.
Since the Arctic Environment Protection Strategy (AEPS), the awareness
of large undisturbed areas in the Arctic has grown, as well as the
realisation of the threats and the speed of fragmentation…All 25 sites
have been described in terras of general features,
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> and major threats possibly
leading to further fragmentation. It seemed to be too big a task to
describe all the features of <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>. In
the report we focused on globally threatened and endemic or semi-endemic
species with almost their entire distribution in the actual wilderness
area or only one more site. In addition we listed species and where
available population status for species very much reliant on large,
undisturbed territories. These include mainly large bird predators and
carnivores, but also migrating species among the mammals or those living
in large herds, such as reindeer, musk, ox and others, particularly
vulnerable to fragmentation. Among the threats we mostly focused on the
exploitation of mineral resources, but also exploitation of forest and
hydropower, as well as the developments in tourism. <a

is the first truely circumpolar overview of Arctic
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> and provides a clear
understanding of the importance of the Earth’s largest ecoregion and its
status in the face of a rapidly changing world. It observes that while
much of the Arctic was in its natural state and that the impacts of
human activity were relatively minor, individuals, species and
ecosystems throughout the Arctic faced threats from many causes, and
that the long-term consequencies of human impacts were unknown. It
particularly noted that the information necessary to determine status
and trends of Arctic fauna was fragmentary and almost non-existent for
flora. <a

working paper provides a global overview of the current coverage of
existing World Heritage Sites of particular importance for the
conservation of <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>, and suggests
existing protected areas of significant
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> value, which may merit future
World Heritage nomination. In 1996, IUCN initiated a project to prepare
a global strategy for Natural World Heritage sites, and as part of this
process began to prepare a series of thematic global overviews on World
Heritage site coverage. This document is an updated addition to these
theme studies. A total of 141 sites, representing 65 countries and over
142 million ha of protected areas were identified as being of particular
importance for <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>. <a

as a resource has two key features: it is absolutely essential for human
survival; the amount of water in the world is constant, so that although
it is used, the stock is not globally diminished but nor can it be
increased. At below global level, water is often not available where and
when needed, nor in the appropriate amounts, nor with the necessary
quality. The two last are particularly important to the maintenance of
freshwater <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>. The finite supply of
freshwater on the Earth is now being used by a human population that has
grown exponentially in the past few hundred years, and continues to
grow, and which demands increasing volumes of water to service
agricultural and industrial processes on which economic development
depends. Freshwater systems are under growing pressure, as flow patterns
are disrupted and the load of waste substances increases. Inevitably per
capita shares of water for human use are decreasing and water stress is
becoming more widespread <a

and ecosystems provide a vast array of valuable services. For example,
about one third of U.S. agricultural output is from insect-pollinated
plants. Nature provides many other services, such as producing raw
materials, purifying water, storing waste, and regulating climate.
Despite the huge value of species and ecosystem services, many such
services are threatened by human activities. Pollinators such as wild
honeybees, for example, are declining as a result of habitat
fragmentation, loss of nesting sites, exposure to pesticides, and many
other factors…In 1997, The Nature Conservancy reported on the
conservation status of 20,439 native US species, representing 13 major
groups of plants and animals that have been classified and studied in
sufficient detail to allow a status assessment for each of their
species. The analysis revealed that, based on their global rarity, about
one third of the species surveyed were in some danger of
extinction…Those animals that depend on freshwater habitats—mussels,
crayfish, fishes, and amphibians—are in the worst condition overall…The
number of threatened and endangered species has risen steadily since
1980. Ecosystems and <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> are
threatened by a variety of factors, including conversion of natural
lands for other uses, pollution, exploitation, and invasions of
non-indigenous species. <a

is clear that even if the above-mentioned numbers should be regarded as
only crude estimates, current extinction rates are dramatically higher
than background extinction rates. For every species that goes extinct,
many populations have become extinct (termed local extinction or
extirpation)…Causes of extinction, i.e. those factors that make
populations vulnerable to extinction in the first place, include habitat
degradation (loss, change in quality and fragmentation),
over-exploitation and persecution, and introductions of alien
species…The rich complexity of both the physical environment and the
interactions among organisms and species appears to be crucial for the
maintenance and generation of <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>.
Thus, the ecosystem and its component communities appear to be very
appropriate targets for conservation, because they take into account
explicitly the many ecological interactions between organisms and their
biotic and abiotic natural environment. A space-orientated approach up
to the landscape scale may be the most appropriate tool with which to
conserve the vast majority of <strong><em>biological

are many reasons why we should conserve
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>. We should hand on to the next
generation an environment no less rich than the one we ourselves
inherited; species which have evolved over many thousands of years may
be lost very quickly and cannot be recreated; natural processes help to
protect our planet, and in maintaining the productivity of our crops, we
depend on a reservoir of wild relatives, and a pool of genetic material
that we can go back to, in order to reinforce our selection. We have
lost over 100 species in the UK this century, including 7% of our
dragonflies, 5% of our butterflies and more than 2% of our fish and
mammals. We acknowledge that policies are now more sensitive to the
needs of <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>, but more needs to be
done to protect and enhance what we have. To improve air quality, we
need to reduce pollutant emissions focusing on photochemical pollution
and particulates. The use of water for domestic, agricultural and
industrial processes can affect <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>
in a variety of ways. Systems for producing, transmitting and using
energy have a direct or indirect impact on
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>, particularly those associated
with electricity generation and transport. Agricultural and fisheries
practices, minerals and aggregates extraction, urbanisation and an
expanding transport network also impact upon
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>. <a

of years ago, humanity learned how to manage the natural environment by
clearing land, growing crops and rearing domesticated animals. Crop
yields and the productivity of animals kept for food have been improved
through cross-breeding, both with other domesticated strains and with
wild relatives which often contain valuable genetic material, including
resistance to certain diseases and pests. Within the past few hundred
years, human activity has had a profound and, in some cases,
irreversible effect on the environment and on individual species. As the
human population has increased, more and more land has been cleared for
agriculture, settlement and industry, and species have been collected
from the wild at an unsustainable rate…Thousands of species worldwide
are under threat from overuse, loss of habitat and environmental
pollution. Because species in ecosystems are interdependent, the loss of
one species can lead to the disappearance of many others. Domestic
animals and crop species are also under threat. Local breeds and crops
are dying out as they are replaced by the small number of crops and
animals developed for modern intensive farming. The value of maintaining
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> is gradually being realized, and
steps are being taken to conserve species and ecosystems. <a

planet is under siege. Assaults on the atmosphere - the greenhouse
effect, the depletion of the ozone layer and increasing air pollution -
pose a still-unquantifled threat to human life. The dumping of hazardous
wastes, and land-based sources of pollution, present a similar threat to
the oceans. On land we are destroying a tropical forest the size of
Austria every year, and more than a hundred species of wild plants and
animals are lost forever each day…Three times since its inception (1982,
1987 and 1992) UNEP has undertaken a more wide-ranging study. The
results of the present study are the most disturbing of the three….The
World Environment 1972-1992 offers a look at the environment from three
perspectives. Ten introductory chapters detail the range of
environmental threats and examine how they have unfolded over the past
two decades. The threats include those that were well known two decades
ago, such as toxic chemicals, air and water pollution, and land
degradation (desertification, deforestation and soil loss). They also
include those that have emerged over the period under review -
stratospheric ozone depletion, <strong><em>loss of
biodiversity</em></strong> and climate change. <a

<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> ever compiled. It represents the
product of numerous scientists, consultants and research institutes each
of whom has generously contributed data or assistance to the compilation
of this Report, together with the substantial information holdings that
WCMC already manages. Yet so vast and diverse are the Earth’s living
resources - the genes, species and ecosystems that comprise the planet’s
biotic wealth - and the threats that these resources now face, that this
massive effort has barely scratched the surface…Over geological time,
all species have a finite span of existence. Species extinction is
therefore a natural process which occurs without the intervention of
man. However, it is beyond question that extinctions caused directly or
indirectly by man are occurring at a rate which far exceeds any
reasonable estimates of background extinction rates, and which, to the
extent that it is correlated with habitat perturbation, must be
increasing. <a

resources are the basis of human life. The intense pressures on
<strong><em>biological diversity</em></strong> are a direct reflection
of increasing human numbers. These pressures are expected to increase
until populations stabilize as projected by the United Nations by about
the year 2050-2070 at about 10 billion. Such stabilization will be
achieved only if present efforts to curtail population growth are
pursued vigorously. As population grows, however, the pressure on
biological resources will reach levels far beyond those prevalent now.
The continued erosion of these resources poses a serious threat of
ecosystem collapse. <strong><em>Biological diversity</em></strong>
losses have serious worldwide implications for agriculture, medicine and
industry; in fact for human welfare and his very existence.
<strong><em>Biological diversity</em></strong> is threatened because
people are out of balance with their environment; benefits are being
gained from exploiting natural habitats without paying the full costs of
such exploitation. Current human populations and standards of living are
subsidized by non-renewable resources that have accumulated over
hundreds of millions of years, yet are being consumed in a few
generations. <a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/28276"

and how they should be conserved. Fortunately, much has been published
on this subject in recent years, yet there has been no obvious route for
the conservation and development community to gain access to this
information quickly and easily. The relevant literature tends to be
markedly mulu- disciplinary, and is thinly scattered across such varied
fields as botany, forestry, ecology, horticulture, planning, economics,
politics and environmental law…This volume contains over 10,000

are at a critical juncture for the conservation and study of

never occur again. Understanding and maintaining that diversity is the
key to humanity’s continued prosperous and stable existence on Earth.
The extinction event that we are witnessing is the most catastrophic
loss of species in the last 65 million years. Most importantly, it is
the first major extinction event that has been caused by a single
species, one that we hope will act in its own self interest to stem the
tide. Unless the international community can, indeed, reverse the trend,
the rate of extinction over the next few decades is likely to rise to at
least 1000 times the normal background rate of extinction, and will
ultimately result in the loss of a quarter or more of the species on
earth. <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/publications/1989/nsb0989.pdf"

number of species and the amount of genetic variation within individual
species. So <strong><em>biological diversity</em></strong> is declining.
If this trend is not hailed and reversed it could have serious and
far-reaching repercussions for humanity. <strong><em>Biological
diversity</em></strong> must be seen as a global resource, like the
atmosphere or the oceans. All nations have a common interest in it and
all have a common responsibility towards it. Despite such action as has
already been taken to promote conservation, there is a pressing need for

diversity</em></strong> must be treated more seriously as a global
resource, to be indexed, used, and above all, preserved. Three
circumstances conspire to give this matter an unprecedented urgency.
First, exploding human populations are degrading the environment at an
accelerating rate, especially in tropical countries. Second, science is
discovering new uses for <strong><em>biological diversity</em></strong>
in ways that can relieve both human suffering and environmental
destruction. Third, much of the diversity is being irreversibly lost
through extinction caused by the destruction of natural habitats, again
especially in the tropics. Overall, we are locked into a race. We must

the “environment” is where we all live; and “development” is what we all
do in attempting to improve our lot within that abode. The two are
inseparable. Further, development issues must be seen as crucial by the
political leaders who feel that their countries have reached a plateau
towards which other nations must strive. Many of the development paths
of the industrialized nations are clearly unsustainable. And the
development decisions of these countries, because of their great
economic and political power, will have a profound effect upon the
ability of all peoples to sustain human progress for generations to
come. Many critical survival issues are related to uneven development,
poverty, and population growth. They all place unprecedented pressures
on the planet’s lands, waters, forests, and other natural resources, not
least in the developing countries. The downward spiral of poverty and
environmental degradation is a waste of opportunities and of resources.
In particular, it is a waste of human resources. These links between
poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation formed a major theme
in our analysis and recommendations. What is needed now is a new era of
economic growth - growth that is forceful and at the same time socially
and environmentally sustainable. <a

in the years leading up to Stockholm, has become of lesser concern to
those commissioning these reviews. As the chapters of the present volume
reveal, this shift of emphasis does not mean that there have not been
significant changes in the physical environment. Carbon dioxide
concentrations in the atmosphere continued to rise, concern about acid
rains grew, and fears about man’s impact on stratospheric ozone
remained. The pollution of the oceans and inland waters and the loss of
soil and of productivity through erosion, desertification and salinity,
were at the forefront of attention. The depletion of <strong><em>genetic

debated. The volume and number of manufactured chemicals reaching the

and water are important requirements for food production. As the need to
increase food production becomes more urgent, man is faced with
continued loss of productive soil through desertification, erosion,
salination and other forms of destructive land use…Overlogging of
tropical forests has had similar effects. It is estimated that already
man’s activities have despoiled some 10 per cent of the world’s arable
land. In addition, good agricultural land is coming under intense
pressure, in both developed and developing countries, from urban uses.
There is still land available which can be brought under cultivation,
but as larger and larger areas are given over to farming, the
unexploited tracts available to serve as reservoirs of
<strong><em>species diversity</em></strong> and natural ecosystems
become smaller and smaller. <a

is both creature and moulder of his environment, which gives him
physical sustenance and affords him the opportunity for intellectual,
moral, social and spiritual growth. In the long and tortuous evolution
of the human race on this planet a stage has been reached when, through
the rapid acceleration of science and technology, man has acquired the
power to transform his environment in countless ways and on an
unprecedented scale. Both aspects of man’s environment, the natural and
the man-made, are essential to his well-being and to the enjoyment of
basic human rights-even the right to life itself…A point has been
reached in history when we must shape our actions throughout the world
with a more prudent care for their environmental consequences. Through
ignorance or indifference we can do massive and irreversible harm to the
earthly environment on which our life and well-being depend. <a

the discussions held by the General Assembly at its twenty-third session
it was emphasized that for the first time in the history of mankind,
there is arising a crisis of world-wide proportions involving developed
and developing countries alike -the crisis of the human environment.
Portents of this crisis have long been apparent- in the explosive growth
of human populations, in the poor integration of a powerful and
efficient technology with environmental requirements, in the
deterioration of agricultural lands, in the unplanned extension of urban
areas, in the decrease of available space and the growing danger of
extinction of many forms of animal and plant life. It is becoming
apparent that if current trends continue, the future of life on earth
could be endangered. It is urgent, therefore, to focus world attention
on those problems which threaten humanity in an environment that permits
the realization of the highest human aspirations, and on the action
necessary to deal with them. <a

emphasis has been put on work programmes concerned with pollution of the
human environment, this being an aspect of the subject-matter outlined
in the Swedish memornndum which has up to the present time concerned
United Nations organizations and prograrmues more than others. Pollution
of the environment, air, water and soiil, from different sources, is
dealt with by the ILO, FAO, UNESCO, WHO, WMO, IAEA and, on the regional
level, ECE. Pollution of the sea caused by ships is the concern of IMCO.
Pollution caused by radiation is the concern of IAEA, UNSCEAR, WHO and
FAO. The proper and rational use of land, including problems of soil
erosion, soil conservation and the establishment and protection of
forests, is being studied particularly by FAO. <a
