want to be clear. Without nature’s help, we will not thrive or even
survive. For too long, we have been waging a suicidal and senseless war
on nature. The result is three interlinked environmental crises, climate
disruption, <strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong>, and pollution,
that threaten our viability as a species. And they are caused by
unsustainable production and consumption. Human well-being lies in
protecting the health of the planet and it is time to re-evaluate and
reset our relationship with nature. And this report can help us to do
so. Today, around the world we are overexploiting and degrading the
environment on land and sea. The atmosphere and ocean have become
dumping grounds for our wastes. And governments are still paying more to
exploit nature than to protect it. Globally, countries spend more some
$4-6 billion a year on subsidies that damage the environment. And the
interlinked climate, <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>, and
pollution crisis require urgent action from the whole of society from
governments, but also from international organizations, from businesses,
from cities, and individuals. People’s choices matter. … <a

is humanity’s best friend. Without nature, we have nothing. Without
nature, we are nothing. Nature is our life-supporting system. It is the
source and sustainer of the air we breathe, the food we eat, the energy
we use, jobs, and economic activities we count on, the species that
enrich human life, and the landscapes and waterscapes we call home. And
yet humanity seems hell-bent on destruction. We are waging war on
nature. This conference is about the urgent task of making peace because
today we are out of harmony with nature. In fact, we are playing an
entirely different song. Around the world for hundreds of years we have
conducted a cacophony of chaos, played with instruments of destruction.
Deforestation and desertification are creating waste lands of once
thriving ecosystems. Our land, water, and air are poisoned by chemicals
and pesticides and choked with plastics. Our addiction to fossil fuels
has thrown our climate into chaos from heatwaves and forest fires to
communities parched by heat and drought or inundated by terrifying
floods…Ecosystems have become play-things of profits. With our
bottomless appetite for unchecked, unequal economic growth, humanity has
become a weapon of mass extinction. We are treating nature like a toilet
and ultimately we are committing suicide by nature because the loss of
nature and <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> comes with a steep
cost…My friends it’s time to forge a peace pact with nature. <a

lives are dependent on <strong><em>biological diversity</em></strong>.
Species and ecosystems are disappearing at an unsustainable rate. We
humans are the cause. We stand to lose a wide variety of environmental
goods and services that we take for granted. The consequences of
economies and people will be profound especially for the world’s poorest
people. In 2002, world leaders agreed to substantially reduce the rate
of <strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> by 2010. We know already
that the <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> target will not be met.
We need new vision and new efforts. Business as usual is not an option.
For this international year of biodiversity, I call on every country and
each citizen of our planet to join together in the global alliance to
protect life on Earth. <strong><em>Biodiversity</em></strong> is life.
<strong><em>Biodiversity</em></strong> is our life. <a

is declining globally at rates unprecedented in human history, causing
fundamental harm to nature and people. IUCN draws urgent attention to
the nature emergency while recognizing it must be tackled in tandem with
climate change. We can address this emergency to the Post-2020
Biodiversity Framework with targets that add up from local to national
to global levels. Together, we must halt <strong><em>biodiversity
loss</em></strong> by 2030 and strive to restoration for net gain by
2050. The Framework must be for everyone. The Rio and
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> related conventions, all
governments, the private sector, indigenous people, local communities,
and all of civil society. It must clearly link to the 2030 agenda and
communicate how <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> conservation is
critical to sustainable development. Our crucial ally is nature itself…

change and loss of <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> are
intrinsically connected. And because they are connected, solutions to
climate change…climate change is looking at nature-based solutions for
climate change so it means <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> is
providing solutions for climate change. Therefore, you cannot deal with
climate change without nature and we cannot deal with nature and

percent of climate mitigation and adaptation to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions will come from <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> nature…

grew up seeing our villages full of trees, very bushy, very cool, plenty
of water. Water would be flowing throughout the year like in small
streams. Water would be flowing in our banana plants which is our staple
food in every each homesteads. But as I continue to grow, by the time I
reached later secondary level, later university, the outlook began
changing. The bush, the forest, you see more holes and spaces. The
weather kept changing. And as I speak, even those rivers that I see when
I get home when you see the water flowing in the streams in backyard
have completely dried up. This is what made me begin asking questions to
myself, what is going on?…But we know
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> just like all other environmental
issues -they are cross-cutting issues. The challenges are cross-cutting.
And therefore, governments alone or national level environmental
ministries alone will not be able to solve all the challenges or to
implement all the targets as expected…So, you can see even biodiversity,
climate change is a primary loss of its loss and yet that same climate
change depends on <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> as part of the
solution. So, clearly the two are linked, cannot be separated, and this
is what we are seeing more and more being spoken… <a

just need to reflect thirty years ago when climate change convention,
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> convention, land degradation
convention or to combat desertification rather were adopted. So while we
are celebrating 50 years of the Human Environment Stockholm Conference,
we are also celebrating 30 years this year of the three conventions.
Yes, in 1992 they were negotiated as three different conventions but
over the years and I think today probably I would like to hear anybody
here who would say that if we are talking of solving climate change, we
can solve climate change without dealing with the loss of
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> or without dealing with land
degradation. So clearly now we are seeing these three planetary
boundaries, they are intrinsically connected and actually solutions to
one will have also contribute to the other and to the three all
contributing to the achievements of the Sustainability Development

have some millet. My life is basically determined by how much I can
generate from the one planet, from the one land that is mine. And that

aim now is to create a very different GEO from those that came before.
Look, we all know the planet is in crisis because the science including
previous years have told us in exhaustive details. We know that the
triple planetary crisis, the crisis of climate change, nature, nature
and <strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong>, and pollution and waste
crisis are threatening to sweep humanity backwards. What we need to do
now is to lay out exactly how to reverse this tide so that we can surge
forwards in a world of equity and prosperity. The world already knows
the many of the solutions to the challenges that the planet and humanity
are facing: renewables, food system reform, energy efficiency, ecosystem
restoration, and much, much more. Solutions can be found quickly and
implemented to help build resilience to climate change, solutions that
can kickstart the long-term system transformation that will wash us up
on the shores of a net zero, nature positive, and resilient world. Yet
to be honest we haven’t put these solutions into practice at a
meaningful scale and speed…I also ask you why we have not made that
progress that you know we should have made, to look at the barriers to
transformation, to figure out how we tear them down… <a

UNEP, we speak of the three planetary crises: the climate crisis, the
nature crisis, and the pollution and waste crisis. And driven by decades
of unsustainable production and consumption, these crises are destroying
our natural systems upon which our economies and societies are built. We
humans have altered over 75% of the terrestrial surface of our planet
and we risk losing one million species on Earth. Climate change
continues unabated. The science is clear and yet we remain unprepared
when shocks associated with these crises occur. So, what do we need to
do? We need to refresh our memories of the commitments that we have made
around the world: to stabilize the climate, to protect the natural
world, to stem pollution. And thereafter, we need to make very real and
meaningful actions to meet the goals that we have agreed. Such
meaningful action also means shifting gear in financial sector, altering
investment flows away from unsustainable production and consumption
patterns: no more financing of coal; deforestation-free food, fuel, and
fiber; a regulatory environment that limits pollution and protection our
environment and nature… <a

positive by 2030, so that by the end of the decade we have more nature
than today not less: more forest, more fishes in the oceans and rivers,
more pollinators in our countryside, more
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> worldwide. A global goal for
nature, nature positive by 2030, that will unite government, businesses,
and consumers to protect more at least 30% of land and sea, to restore
more of what lost and degraded, and to drive to sustainable practices in
key economic sectors that today are responsible for nature loss. Top of

have 50 years since the Stockholm Declaration and 30 years since Rio
Convention and there are several other numbers that float around, COP26
last year, 27 this year, 15 for the two conventions. All that what that
means is all those number of years have passed since the recognition,
the acknowledgment with the issue we are all trying to do deal with and
not much has changed during that time in terms of the emergency, in
terms of the urgency of addressing those three areas of environment:
climate, <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>, and desertification,
land degradation and so. All our conventions are linked, interlinked,
interdependent. And we coordinate and work very, very closely with each
other but not enough because there is still lot that needs to be done.
And you have facilities like GEF that provides lots of impetus to
provide that coordination. One very good example was recently at GEF6…is
that taking the integrated approach and programming to breaking the
silos and harnessing the maximum benefits of the three Rio conventions.
And I think that is a very, very good example and more needs to be done
in that regard… <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t_-JXiXEoc"

know, you know, nature is in crisis. The science is unequivocal. Our
very survival is at risk as well as entire ecosystems and more than a
million other species. The <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> and
pandemic crisis are in deadly lockstep with the climate crisis. We all
know and agree we need, we demand, a strong post-2020 global
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> framework. These must set and
achieve clear, measurable milestones and targets to achieve the mission
of being nature positive, that is, halting and reversing the loss of
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> by conserving and restoring it by
2030…Now must be the turning point where we stop trashing and destroying
nature. Now is the moment to overwhelmingly redress our dangerous and
violent relationship with the planet and demand from ourselves, our
governments, and all players action not words. Many young people have a
finely tuned ear for what they call blah blah blah. My daughters have an
uncanny ability to see through our words. Let us prove them wrong. Prove
to my daughters and your children and grandchildren that
transformational change is not empty words but concrete and measurable
action in our daily lives and our daily acts. Ambitions and aspirations
alone will not save nature, will not reverse climate change, and will
not prevent the next pandemic. Only action will… <a

we are all citizens of this one planet because unless we do we will not
solve the problems…We know what the problems are and we know how to
solve them. All we lack is unified action. These problems cannot be
solved by one nation, no matter how big that one single nation is. The

benefits: affordable clean energy, healthier and enough food to sustain
us all. Nature is a key ally. Wherever we restore the wild, it will
recapture carbon and help us bring back balance to our planet. And as we
work to build a better world, we must acknowledge no nation has
completed its development because no advanced nation is yet sustainable.
All have a journey still to compete so that all nations have a good
standard of living and modest footprint…We are a force powerful enough
to destabilize our planet. Surely, working together we are powerful
enough to save it. In my lifetime I have witnessed a terrible decline.

today is Earth Day. It’s a day to think about the planet, Mother Earth.
I am sure that all of you have seen photos of planet Earth shot from
space: a small green and blue globe surrounded by the cold black
immensity of space. What is so wonderful about this little planet of
ours is that during the millions of years of evolution it supports such
a <strong><em>rich variety of lifeforms</em></strong> from microscopic
bacteria and algae to whales and elephants and the giant redwoods. There
are some species that live in the Earth such as earthworms and naked
mole rats, others that fly like butterflies and beetles and birds and
bats. Some spend all or almost all their time in trees like sloths and
galegos and spider monkeys. Some move ever so slowly across the land
like tortoises while others like cheetahs can run really fast. Then
there are all those who spend their entire lives in the water: the
corals and fish and whales, while others like otters and penguins spend
time on land but are really good swimmers. Then think about the hundreds
and thousands of plants and trees and fungi and ferns. What an amazing
tapestry of living things! We humans are just one species but oh dear
our footprint on the planet is gigantic… <a

Day 2021. It should be a day to celebrate the existence of planet Earth
with is amazing <strong><em>diversity of plants and animal
species</em></strong>, its beautiful forests, oceans, rivers, wetlands,
and prairies, and all of its wonderful habitats -a small green and blue
sphere circling the sun…So, Earth Day is a day to reflect not only on
the wonders of our planet but also the harm we humans have inflicted on
it…I was somewhere in space looking down on my sister Earth so
threatened by human activities. The waves of the sea seemed to be asking
me to clean the water from the pollution and plastic, and the fish
wanted to be saved from huge drift nets, and all the animals of the
ocean were desperate for a way to escape the non-stop terrible sonar
noise. It was making their lives unbearable. The trees were reaching
towards me with their branches even as giant machines were slicing
through their living trunks and the forest were weeping with tears of
sap, begging to be saved. The tall golden grass of one of the small
remaining patches of prairies were sighing in the wind and everywhere
the animals were reaching towards me, frogs and water birds pleaded as
their homes were relentlessly drained for yet another industrial
complex. Elephants and rhinos, lions and tigers, pangolins, bears, and
sharks cried out as they were killed for their tusks and horns and
scales, bile and fins… <a

influences <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> and vice versa. So
from a scientific point of view, it is therefore key to bring climate
and <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> together. It is beneficial
also to bring them together at the political level and to design

what is the most important environmental issue? Well actually, the most
important environmental issue is that we have to transform our
relationship with nature so that we address the climate crisis, the
<strong><em>biodiversity crisis</em></strong>, and the pollution and
waste crisis. So we are on track to a global warming of 3 degrees within
this century, that is quite disastrous actually, 1 million of 8 million
plants and animal species are at risk of extinction. We really depend on
them and is also a senseless thing to move towards. Finally, on
pollution 9 million lives every year are lost prematurely to air
pollution, water pollution and toxic substances. And besides are waters
and oceans are choking with plastic. So these are interrelated crisis
actually, reinforcing each other and a result of same underlying driver
which is the tremendous expansion of human activities over the last

is to give you the scientific update on why action on climate change
requires also investments in a massive scale in nature positive which
includes multiple benefits for <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>,
climate stability, and the planetary resilience. We are today in the
midst of the Anthropocene, a geological epoch where we are now the
dominating force of change on the entire planet. We know that this is
playing out in four interconnected crises. We are all talking about the
climate crisis. We are in the tail end, hopefully, of the COVID-19
crisis, a pandemic that originates from unsustainable exploitation of
nature habitats with a zoonosis that spills over from wildlife via
domestic animals to humans. We have the Ukraine geopolitical instability
in the world. We are also having the ecological crisis and this is a
crisis today of massive scale. We are in the sixth mass extinction of
species. The intergovernmental platform on
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> and ecosystem services concludes
the drama: we are at risk o losing 1 million of 8 million known species;
70% of the populations of animal species have been lost in one
generation since 1970. We are undermining the functions in the Earth
System that can provide good lives, well-being, and development for
humanity… <a href="LINK" target="_blank"><strong><em>Hear</em>

make that quite clear…When you read economic forecasts they talk about
investments in factories and employment rates, GDP growth. They never
mention what is happening in the ecosystems. So, I tried to reconstruct
economics by placing the human economy as embedded in nature. My
intention is on the productivity of nature and showing how economic
possibilities are entirely dependent on this finite entity we call
nature. Global demand for nature’s goods and services exceed nature’s
ability to supply them on a sustainable basis…GDP will not count that
destruction. You can have a growing GDP but put huge pressure on the
biosphere, leading to <strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong>,
climate change… <a

at the expense of the other. This is particularly important within the

humans are destroying <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>. We are
degrading our ecosystems. We’re causing land degradation and we are
changing the Earth’s climate. These are not just environmental issues.
They are development issues, they are economic issues, they are social,
security, and ethical issues. And this is what we have to get across to
people. They really are fundamental to human well-being whether you are
in a rich country or a poor country. And unfortunately, most of the
problems being caused by the rich countries and the people most
adversely affected are poor people in developing countries. There are 20
or so-called <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> Aichi targets…they
will not be met by most countries in most parts of the world. The 1.5 to
2 degree target of the Paris Agreement will not be met not with the
current pledges anyway. And the time for action is clearly now and in
fact the time for action was ten years ago, twenty years ago, and thirty
years ago. And the message is a whole bunch of big environmental
assessments. There’s GEO6 run by UNEP. There’s Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change. There’s IPBES. And we are all saying the same things.
We need rapid, transformative changes across the world if we are going
to deal with climate, loss of biodiversity, and land degradation. And if
we don’t deal with them, we will not meet most of the UN Sustainability
Goals…. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAwqbtUmNTY"

will start with our most fundamental message and that message is: nature
and the contributions it provides are fundamental to all people around
the world. People no matter who they are, no matter where they are, are
sustained inextricably and interwoven with the fabric of life. We refer
to this fabric of life simply as nature all the way from the most
pristine and remote forest to your garden. Nature provides materials for
fetals, physical and cultural continuity and underpins all dimensions of
human health, and support identity. Nature is the basis for our images
and our stories. We are not truly ourselves without nature. And many of
these contributions are not satisfactorily replaceable by human assets.
But paradoxically, there is now incontestable evidence that nature and
many its present contributions to human quality of life and its capacity
to continue providing such benefits in the future are deteriorating fast
worldwide. It’s true that more food and energy and raw materials than
ever before are now being supplied to people across distant regions. But
this comes at a price. Globally, since the 70s, out of 18 general
categories of nature’s contributions to people assessed by IPBES, 14
have declined. This means that the increases in production and
associated waste are undermining nature’s capacity to regulate processes
and regenerate itself, the capacity of nature to provide non-material
contributions to people, and increasingly ensure nature’s ability to
provide all contributions in the future including materials ones… <a

often ask me how do I rate the <strong><em>biodiversity
crisis</em></strong> as compared to the climate change crisis and the
poverty and inequality crisis? I think people like this question because
they see <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> as the animals and
plants are quite separate from us. From science tells us that living
nature is much more than an inventory of species. Living nature as you
say is the fabric of life, the living fabric of the planet, the
interrelated in which all the living including us humans are interwoven.
And this living fabric is the essential to functioning of planet and to
human well-being. Unfortunately, we have now incontestable evidence that
the living fabric of the Earth is being unraveled fast. And the ultimate
reason why this is happening is the present dominant model of
appropriating nature, doing business, and relating to each other. So,
runaway climate change, massive <strong><em>biodiversity
loss</em></strong>, and intolerable social and environmental
inequalities among people are simply the three most serious symptoms of
same root problem. Therefore, they cannot be an appropriate solution for
these three existential challenges without tackling them together in a
coordinated way and without realizing that the living fabric of the
Earth is at the core of the three challenges… <a

we tend to forget we are transforming the
<strong><em>biosphere</em></strong> directly just as much and perhaps
even more than we are transforming the climate. There was a big
equivalent study…published in 2019, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy
Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. They came up with a
number of very important conclusions from this very exhaustive study.
Here are the most important. Nature is now declining at rates
unprecedented in human history. About 1 million animal and plant
species, that’s out of a total of about 8 or 9 animal and plant species,
are now threatened with extinction. In other words, we have now entered
the Sixth Great Mass Extinction event in the history of Earth. And they
sum it up by the web of life on Earth on which we all depend are getting
smaller and increasingly frayed… <a

people talk about sustainability, it is very common to hear the three
pillars that is: economic, social, and environmental. And again, this
goes back to our earlier conversation about trade-offs. People say well
maybe we have to trade off some environmental value because we need to
develop economically or maybe we maybe we need to not develop
economically here because it is too damaging to
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> and environment so we have to
trade them off. What we did when we looked at the planetary boundaries
in particular and may also work at other scales is that they are not
three equal pillars that you trade off. It is in fact what we call a
nested hierarchy. Think of three circles one inside the other one. The
big circle on the outside is the environment. And if you don’t think
that is important, think about how you are going to try to live when the
environment really goes bad if we lose oxygen in the atmosphere, if we
have a climate that isn’t stable, if we can’t derive ecosystem services
because we lost too much biodiversity. So I like to tell people don’t
use the word environment, use the word life-support system because that
is what it is. We are dependent on it for our very existence… <a

<blockquote>
Most of humanity has historically fought against nature, draining
wetlands, razing forests for urban development, canalising rivers and
introducing monocultures with heavy use of fertilisers and pesticides.
The future will have to look fundamentally different by working with
nature if we are to reverse the severe <strong><em>loss of
biodiversity</em></strong>, tackle the climate crisis and restore a
billion hectares of healthy ecosystems that have been lost over the last
few decades.
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>With sufficient finance, nature-based solutions (NbS) provide the
means to cost-effectively reach climate,
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> and land degradation neutrality
targets, particularly if investments simultaneously contribute to
biodiversity, climate and restoration targets. This “double” or “triple”
win potential is particularly alluring given the current economic
situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Delayed action is no longer an option in the face of the devastating
effects of climate change, the extinction crisis and severe land
degradation globally. Politicians, business and finance leaders and
citizens globally must transform their relationship with nature to work
with it rather than against it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we rapidly double finance flows to NbS, we can halt
<strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> (measured through the
Biodiversity Intactness Index below), significantly contribute to
reducing emissions (5 GtCO2/year by 2025 further rising to 15 GtCO2/year
by 2050 in the 1.5°C scenario) and restore close to 1 billion ha of
degraded land.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Private sector investment in NbS must increase by several orders of
magnitude in the coming years from the current US$26 billion per year,
which represents only 17 per cent of total NbS investment.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Government expenditure on environmentally harmful subsidies to
fisheries, agriculture and fossil fuels is estimated at US$500 billion
to 1 trillion per year, which is three to seven times greater than
public and private investments in NbS. These flows severely undermine
efforts to achieve critical environmental targets.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Investment in marine NbS constitutes only 9 per cent of total
investment in NbS, which is very low given the role of theoceans in
climate mitigation and supporting adaptation, food security and
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> conservation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Governments need to lock in critical targets on
<strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong>, take urgent action to raise
ambition and implement emissions reduction targets in line with the
Paris Agreement and action land restoration commitments. These targets
must be underpinned by broad based resource mobilisation from all
sources. Public and private actors need to mobilise the necessary
finance and close the finance gap while governments anchor targets in
national regulation/legislation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Increase direct finance flows to NbS through public domestic
expenditure, nature-focused Official Development Assistance (ODA),
ensuring that multilateral development banks (MDBs) and development
finance institutions (DFIs) prioritise green finance, and providing
regulation and incentives for private sector investment, particularly in
nature markets and sustainable supply chains.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Companies in the real economy and financial institutions need to
transition to “net zero, net positive” and equitable business models in
a time-bound manner with short-term targets.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Public and private sector efforts to scale up NbS investments need to
integrate just transition principles, safeguarding human rights. This
includes providing social protection, land rights and decent working
conditions and the participation of local and indigenous communities,
including women and otherm arginalised and vulnerable groups.</p>

Today we face the double, interlinked emergencies of human-induced
climate change and the <strong><em>loss of biodiversity</em></strong>,
threatening the well-being of current and future generations. As our
future is critically dependent on <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>
and a stable climate, it is essential that we understand how nature’s
decline and climate change are connected.
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Land-use change is still the biggest current threat to nature,
destroying or fragmenting the natural habitats of many plant and animal
species on land, in freshwater and in the sea. However, if we are unable
to limit warming to 1.5°C, climate change is likely to become the
dominant cause of <strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> in the
coming decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tracking the health of nature over almost 50 years, the Living Planet
Index acts as an early warning indicator by tracking trends in the
abundance of mammals, fish, reptiles, birds and amphibians around the
world. In its most comprehensive finding to date, this edition shows an
average 69% decline in the relative abundance of monitored wildlife
populations around the world between 1970 and 2018.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in average
population abundance (94%), while freshwater species populations have
seen the greatest overall global decline (83%).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We know that transformational change – game-changing shifts– will be
essential to put theory into practice. We need system-wide changes in
how we produce and consume, the technology we use, and our economic and
financial systems. Underpinning these changes must be a move from goals
and targets to values and rights, in policy-making and in day-to-day
life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A nature-positive future needs transformative - game changing -
shifts in how we produce, how we consume, how we govern, and what we
finance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Achieving net-zero loss for nature is certainly not enough; we need a
nature- or net-positive goal to restore nature and not simply halt its
loss. Firstly, because we have lost and continue to lose so much nature
at such a speed that we need this higher ambition.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Climate change and <strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> are
not only environmental issues, but economic, development, security,
social, moral and ethical issues too – and they must therefore be
addressed together along with the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Climate change and <strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> are
not only environmental issues, but economic, development, security,
social, moraland ethical issues too.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless we conserve and restore biodiversity, and limit human-induced
climate change, almost none of the [17 UN Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs)] can be achieved – in particular food and water security, good
health for everyone, poverty alleviation, and a more equitable
world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone has a role to play in addressing these emergencies; and most
now acknowledge that transformations aren eeded. This recognition now
needs to be turned into action.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Human-driven global warming is changing the natural world, driving
mass mortality events as well as the first extinctions of entire
species. Every degree of warming is expected to increase these losses
and the impact they have on people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Warming is also changing how ecosystems function, putting into motion
ecological processes that, themselves, in time cause more warming: this
process is called a ‘positive climate feedback’.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Increases in wildfires, trees dying due to drought and
insectoutbreaks, peatlands drying and tundra permafrost thawing, all
release more CO₂ as dead plant material decomposes or is burned. This is
starting to transform systems that have historically been solid carbon
sinks into new carbon sources.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Once these ecological processes reach a tipping point they will
become irreversible and commit our planet to continue warming at a very
high rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Forests are critical for stabilising our climate, but deforestation
threatens this vital function as well as other ecosystem services
including buffering against the impact of heatwaves, and providing
freshwater to agricultural lands.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ecological connectivity is severely threatened by the destruction and
degradation of nature that fragments habitats. To counter this,
connectivity conservation is rapidly emerging as a solution to restore
the movement of species and the flow of natural processes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Around the globe, it is clear that leaders in dominant societies have
failed to control the human activities driving climate change and
habitat loss, while Indigenous lands and waters have been successfully
taken care of over millennia 80 . In Canada, Brazil and Australia, for
instance, vertebrate <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> in
Indigenous territories equals or surpasses that found within formally
protected areas.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Indigenous approaches to conservation regularly place reciprocal
people-place relationships at the centre of cultural and care practices.
These approaches hinge on systems of Indigenous knowledge which include
scientific and ecological understandings that are carried across
generations through language, story, ceremony, practice and law.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With a fundamental, system-wide reorganisation across technological,
economic and social factors, including paradigms, goals and values,
there might still be a chance that we can reverse the trend of nature’s
decline.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Economics, at its core, is the study of how people make choices under
conditions of scarcity, and of the consequences of those choices for
society. Simply put, we need to move to an economy that values
well-being in its diverse forms, not only monetary, and one which is
fully responsive to resource scarcity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A global goal of reversing <strong><em>biodiversity
loss</em></strong> to secure a nature-positive world by 2030 is
necessary if we are to turn the tide on nature loss and safeguard the
natural world for current and future generations. It must be our guiding
star, in the same way that the goal of limiting global warming to 2°C,
and preferably 1.5°C, guides our efforts on climate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Recognition of the integrated nature of our environmental challenges
in turn enables the search for win-win solutions. Again, the science is
clear: immediate action to reverse <strong><em>biodiversity
loss</em></strong> is essential if we are to succeed in limiting climate
change to 1.5°C; and climate change is expected to become a dominant
driver of <strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> if left
unchecked.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It will only be through identifying and pursuing solutions that
tackle these connected challenges while also benefiting people that we
will be able to course-correct and secure a healthier natural world, to
help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

– provide the foundation for the wealth ofour societies and economies.
They meet the growing needs and desires for food, water,fuel, and other

<p>Roughly USD 44 trillion of economic output – more than half of global
annual GDP– is moderately or highly reliant on natural capital. Yet
governments, markets, and societies rarely account for the true value of
all nature’s services that underpin human and environmental health.
These include climate and water regulation, disease and pest control,
waste decomposition and air purification, as well as recreation and
cultural amenities.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Conserving, restoring, andusing our land resources sustainably is a
global imperative: one that requires moving to acrisis footing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At no other point in modern history has humanity faced such an array
of familiar and unfamiliar risks and hazards, interacting in a
hyper-connected and rapidly changing world. We cannot afford to
underestimate the scale and impact of these existential threats. Rather
we must work to motivate and enable all stakeholders to go beyond
existing development and business models to activate a restorative
agenda for people, nature, and the climate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Land restoration is essential and urgently needed. It must be
integrated with allied measures to meet future energy needs while
drastically reducing greenhouse gasemissions; address food insecurity
and water scarcity while shifting to more sustainable production and
consumption; and accelerate a transition to a regenerative, circular
economy that reduces waste and pollution.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Restoration is a proven and cost-effective solution to help reverse
climate change and <strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> caused by
the rapid depletion of our finite natural capital stocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Land restoration is broadly understood as a continuum of sustainable
land and water management practices that can be applied to conserve or
‘rewild’ natural areas, ‘up-scale’ nature-positive food production in
rural landscapes, and ‘green’ urban areas, infrastructure, and supply
chains.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The land restoration agenda is a multiple benefits strategy that
reverses past land and ecosystem degradation while creating
opportunities that improve livelihoods and prepareus for future
challenges.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Land is the operative link between <strong><em>biodiversity
loss</em></strong> and climate change, and therefore must be the primary
focus of any meaningful intervention to tackle these intertwined crises.
Restoring degraded land and soil provides the most fertile ground on
which to take immediate and concerted action.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Land and ecosystem restoration will help slow global warming, reduce
the risk, scale, frequency, and intensity of disasters (e.g., pandemics,
drought, floods), and facilitate the recovery of critical
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> habitat and ecological
connectivity to avoid extinctions and restore the unimpeded movement of
species and the flow of natural processes that sustain life on
Earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Restoration is needed in the right places and at the right scales to
better manage interconnected global emergencies. Responsible governance
and land use planning will be key to protecting healthy and productive
land and recuperating biodiverse, carbon-rich ecosystems to avoid
dangerous tipping points.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern agriculture has altered the face of the planet more than any
other human activity– from the production of food, animal feed, and
other commodities to the marketsand supply chains that connect producers
to consumers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Making our food systems sustainable and resilient would be a
significant contribution to the success of the global land,
biodiversity, and climate agendas.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Globally, food systems are responsible for 80% of deforestation, 70%
of freshwater use, and are the single greatest cause of terrestrial
<strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the same time, soil health and
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> below ground – the source of
almost all our food calories – has been largely neglected by the
industrial agricultural revolution of the last century.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Intensive monocultures and the destruction of forests and other
ecosystems for food and commodity production generate the bulk of carbon
emissions associated with land use change. Nitrous oxides from
fertilizer use and methane emitted by ruminant livestock comprise the
largest and most potent share of agricultural greenhouse gas
emissions</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Top-down solutions to avoid or reduce land degradation and water
scarcity are unlikely to succeed without bottom-up stakeholder
engagement and the security of land tenure and resource rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At the same time, trusted institutions and networks are needed tohelp
build bridges that bring together different forms of capital to restore
land health and create dignified jobs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More inclusive and responsible governance can facilitate the shift to
sustainable land use and management practices by building human and
social capital.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Increased transparency and accountability are prerequisites for
integrated land use planning and other administrative tools that can
help deliver multiple benefits at various scales while managing
competing demands.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Redirecting public spending towards regenerative land management
solutions offers a significant opportunity to align private sector
investment with longer-term societal goals– not only for food, fuel, and
raw materials, but also for green and blue infrastructure for drought
and flood mitigation, renewable energy provision,
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> conservation, and water and waste
recycling.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Territorial and landscape approaches can leverage public and private
financing for large-scale or multi-sector restoration initiatives by
allowing diverse groups of stakeholders to establish partnerships that
pool resources, aggregate project activities, and share costs. These
collaborative approaches will make land restoration initiatives more
effective and attractive to donors and investors.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The stark implications of the business-as-usual scenario means that
decisive action at all levels and from all actors is needed to realize
the promise of the restoration scenarios contained in this Outlook.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What is clear and unequivocal is the need for coordinated measures to
meaningfully slow or reverse climate change, land degradation, and
<strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> to safeguard human health
and livelihoods, ensure food and water security, and leave a sustainable
legacy for future generations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ambitious land restoration targets must be backed by clear action
plans and sustained financing. Countries that are disproportionately
responsible for the climate, biodiversity, and environmental crises must
do more to support developing countries as they restoretheir land
resources and make these activities central to building healthier and
more resilient societies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration is galvanizing indigenous
peoples and local communities, governments, the private sector, and
civil society as part of a global movement to undertake all types of
restoration, across all scales, marshalling all possible resources. This
powerful 10-year ambition aims to transform land and water management
practices to meet the demands of the 21st century while eradicating
poverty, hunger, and malnutrition.</p>

<p>The world’s ecosystems – from oceans to forests to farmlands – are
being degraded, in many cases at an accelerating rate. People living in
poverty, women, indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups bear
the brunt of this damage, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only worsened
existing inequalities.</p>

<p>Ecosystem restoration is needed on a large scale in order to achieve
the sustainable development agenda.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The conservation of healthy ecosystems – while vitally important – is
now not enough. We are using the equivalent of 1.6 Earths to maintain
our current way of life, and ecosystems cannot keep up with our demands.
Simply put, we need more nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Half of the world’s GDP is dependent on nature, and every dollar
invested in restoration creates up to USD 30 dollars in economic
benefits.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Restoring productive ecosystems is essential to supporting food
security. Restoration through agroforestry alone has the potential to
increase food security for 1.3 billion people. Restoring the populations
of marine fish to deliver a maximum sustainable yield could increase
fisheries production by 16.5 million tonnes, an annual value of USD 32
billion.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Actions that prevent, halt and reverse degradation are needed if we
are to keep global temperatures below 2°C. Such actions can deliver
one-third of the mitigation that is needed by 2030. This could involve
action to better manage some 2.5 billion hectares of forest, crop and
grazing land (through restoration and avoiding degradation) and
restoration of natural cover over 230 million hectares.</p>

<p>Large-scale investments in dryland agriculture, mangrove protection
and water management will make a vital contribution to building
resilience to climate change, generating benefits around four times the
original investment.</p>

<p>With careful planning, restoring 15 per cent of converted lands while
stopping further conversion of natural ecosystems could avoid 60 per

<blockquote>
Climate change and <strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> are two
of the most pressing issues of the Anthropocene. While there is
recognition in both scientific and policy-making circles that the two
are interconnected, in practice they are largely addressed in their own
domains.
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Each issue has its own international Convention (the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological
Diversity), and each has an intergovernmental body which assesses
available knowledge (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) and the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
Services (IPBES)). This functional separation creates a risk of
incompletely identifying, understanding and dealing with the connections
between the two.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Increasing energy consumption, overexploitation of natural resources
and unprecedented transformation of land-, freshwater- and seascapes
over the past 150 years have paralleled technological advances and
supported better living standards for many but have also led to changes
in climate and the accelerating decline of biological diversity
worldwide, both negatively impacting many aspects of good quality of
life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To be holistically effective, renewable energy development will
benefit from consideration of a circular economy and, ultimately,
biodiversity</p>

<p>The mutual reinforcing of climate change and <strong><em>biodiversity
loss</em></strong> means that satisfactorily resolving either issue
requires consideration of the other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These interactions can generate complex feedbacks between climate,

pronounced and less predictable outcomes. Ignoring the inseparable
nature of climate, biodiversity, and human quality of life will result
in non-optimal solutions to either crisis.</p>

<p>Previous policies have largely tackled the problems of climate change
and <strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> independently. Policies
that simultaneously address synergies between mitigating

also considering their societal impacts, offer the opportunity to
maximize co-benefits and help meet development aspirations for all.</p>

<p>Cross-cutting issues, intersectoral policies and regulatory
frameworks are areas where strong synergies could contribute to the
transformative societal change that is needed to achieve ambitious goals

<p>Nature-based solutions (NbS) can play an important role in climate
mitigation, but the extent is debated, and they can only be effective
with ambitious reductions in all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.
Nature-based solutions can be most effective when planned for longevity
and not narrowly focussed on rapid carbon sequestration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Avoiding and reversing the loss and degradation of carbon- and

importance for combined <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>
protection and climate change mitigation actions with large adaptation
co-benefits.</p>

<p>Sustainable agricultural and forestry practices can improve adaptive
capacity, enhance biodiversity, increase carbon storage in farmland and
forest soils and vegetation, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

climate mitigation actions, in both the short and long-term are
considered when evaluating their contribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Planting bioenergy crops (including trees, perennial grasses or
annual crops) in monocultures over a very large share of total land area
is detrimental to ecosystems, reduces supply of many other nature’s
contributions to people and impedes achievement of numerous Sustainable
Development Goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Afforestation, which involves planting trees in ecosystems that have
not historically been forests, and reforestation with monocultures,

<p>Technology-based measures that are effective for climate change
mitigation can pose serious threats to biodiversity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Measures intended to facilitate adaptation to one aspect of climate
change without considering other aspects of sustainability may in
practice be maladaptive and result in unforeseen detrimental
outcomes.</p>

benefits for climate change mitigation, but those benefits may be
sub-optimal compared to measures that account for both

<p>Treating climate, <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> and human
society as coupled systems is key to successful outcomes from policy

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Assessing the range of viable solutions (‘solution space’) to achieve
the intended climate mitigation, adaptation and

<blockquote>
<p>Existing governance systems often lack effective mechanisms to
improve integration between climate and biodiversity, and between
international and national to subnational scales.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall, mainstreaming of <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> into
climate policy and vice versa, and of both into initiatives to advance
human development and good quality of life, remains limited at many
scales and in many sectors, although there are some promising
initiatives emerging, such as jurisdictional approaches, experimental
policy mixes, and rights-based approaches.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A key outcome for successfully integrated governance of climate,
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> and good quality of life will be
to help identify solutions for stewardship that deliver the highest
co-benefits while avoiding trade-offs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Multi-actor and multi-scale governance are appropriate approaches to
the management of multifunctional ‘scapes’ at different scales.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The imperative for rapid action on both climate change and
<strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> argues for governance models
to move beyond state-based approaches to embrace more collaborative
solutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Transformative change can occur using leverage points in
socio-ecological systems which alter future trajectories. Critical
leverage points include exploring alternative visions of good quality of
life, rethinking consumption and waste, shifting values related to the
human-nature relationship, reducing inequalities, and promoting
education and learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Better tools for multi-sectoral scenario planning and modelling can
help map pathways to simultaneously achieve the goals in the SDGs, the
Paris Agreement and the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework in the
medium and long term.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Achieving the scale and scope of transformative change needed to meet
the goals of the UNFCCC and CBD and the Sustainable Development Goals
relies on rapid and far-reaching actions of a type never before
attempted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It includes new integrative agendas aligning all actors, private to
public, in support of actions to protect biodiversity, reduce the
impacts of climate change, and achieve sustainable development.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Transformative change elements identified can include effective
incentives and capacity-building, improved cooperation across sectors
and jurisdictions, anticipatory and pre-emptive actions, inclusive and
adaptive decision-making, and strengthened environmental policy and
implementation.</p>

<blockquote>
Humanity’s environmental challenges have grown in number and severity
ever since the Stockholm Conference in 1972 and now represent a
planetary emergency.
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Earth’s environmental emergencies and human well-being need to be
addressed together to achieve sustainability. The development of the
goals, targets, commitments and mechanisms under the key environmental
conventions and their implementation need to be aligned to become more
synergistic and effective.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The economic, financial and productive systems can and should be
transformed to lead and power the shift to sustainability. Society needs
to include natural capital in decision-making, eliminate environmentally
harmful subsidies and invest in the transition to a sustainable
future.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone has a role to play in ensuring that human knowledge,
ingenuity, technology and cooperation are redeployed from transforming
nature to transforming humankind‘s relationship with nature. Polycentric
governance is key to empowering people to express themselves and act
environmentally responsibly without undue difficulty or
self-sacrifice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Human well-being critically depends on the Earth’s natural systems.
Yet the economic, technological and social advances have also led to a
reduction of the Earth’s capacity to sustain current and future human
well-being. Human prosperity relies on the wise use of the planet’s
finite space and remaining resources, as well as on the protection and
restoration of its life-supporting processes and capacity to absorb
waste.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last 50 years, the global economy has grown nearly fivefold,
due largely to a tripling in extraction of natural resources and energy
that has fuelled growth in production and consumption.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The increasingly unequal and resource-intensive model of development
drives environmental decline through climate change,
<strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> and other forms of pollution
and resource degradation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The international community has set targets, informed by science, in
multi-lateral agreements for protecting natural assets and limiting
harmful environmental change. Despite some progress, efforts to date
have failed to meet any of the agreed targets.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Economic and financial systems fail to account for the essential
benefits that humanity gets from nature and to provide incentives to
manage nature wisely and maintain its value.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Climate change, <strong><em>loss of biodiversity</em></strong>, land
degradation, and accumulating chemicals and waste reinforce each other
and are caused by the same indirect drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As a result of the <strong><em>loss of biodiversity</em></strong> and
ecosystem services, nature’s ability to support human health through
regulation of air and water quality is in decline in many places, as
well as its ability to provide opportunities for recreation and
relaxation, which support physical and mental health and well-being.
<strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> is also negatively affecting
nature’s ability to supply medicines.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Global warming of more than 2°C combined with continued
<strong><em>loss of biodiversity</em></strong> and increasing pollution
will likely have dire consequences for humanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Decades of incremental efforts have not stemmed the environmental
decline resulting from an expansive development model because vested and
short-term interests often prevail.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Only system-wide transformation will enable humanity to achieve
well-being for all within the Earth’s finite capacity to provide
resources and absorb human waste. This transformation will involve a
fundamental change in the technological, economic and social
organization of society, including world views, norms, values and
governance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the interconnected nature of climate change, <strong><em>loss
of biodiversity</em></strong>, land degradation, and air and water
pollution, it is essential that these problems are tackled together.
Response options that address multiple issues can mitigate
multidimensional vulnerability, minimize trade-offs and maximize
synergies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong><em>loss of biodiversity</em></strong> can only be halted
and reversed by providing space dedicated for nature while also
addressing drivers such as changing land and sea use, overexploitation,
climate change, pollution and invasive alien species.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The adverse effects of chemicals and waste on the environment and
human health can be substantially reduced by implementing existing
international chemicals conventions. Further progress will require
strengthening the science-policy interface as the basis for
evidence-based policymaking and improved management systems, along with
legal and regulatory reform.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Governments should incorporate full natural capital accounting into
their decision-making and use policies and regulatory frameworks to
provide incentives for businesses to do the same. Yardsticks such as
inclusive wealth (the sum of produced, natural, human and social
capital) provide a better basis for investment decisions than gross
domestic product, as they reflect the capacity of current and future
generations to achieve and sustain higher living standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Changes in global patterns of consumption are critical to
transforming food, water and energy systems, and to challenging social
norms and business practices. Improving access to safe, nutritious and
affordable food for all, while reducing food waste and changing dietary
choices and consumer behaviour in high-income countries and groups, is
central for the achievement of hunger, biodiversity, waste and climate
goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cities and other settlements, especially rapidly expanding urban
areas and informal settlements, must be made more sustainable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All actors have individual, complementary and nested roles to play in
bringing about cross-sectoral and economy-wide transformative change
with immediate and long-term impact. This can be enhanced through
capacity-building and education.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Governments initiate and lead in intergovernmental cooperation,
policies and legislation that transform society and the economy. Such
transformations enable the private sector, financial institutions,
labour organizations, scientific and educational bodies and media as
well as households and civil society groups to initiate and lead
transformations in their domains.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Individuals can facilitate transformation by, for instance,
exercising their voting and civic rights, changing their diets and
travel habits, avoiding waste of food and resources, and reducing their
consumption of water and energy. They can also promote behavioural
change by raising awareness in their communities. Human cooperation,
innovation and knowledge-sharing will create new social and economic
possibilities and opportunities in the transformation to a sustainable
future.</p>

<blockquote>
But like education and health, Nature is more than a mere economic good.
Nature nurtures and nourishes us, so we will think of assets as durable
entities that not only have use value, but may also have intrinsic
worth. Once we make that extension, the economics of
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> becomes a study in portfolio
management.
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The damage inflicted on each type of asset (buildings, forests, the
atmosphere, fisheries, human health) should be interpreted as
depreciation of that asset. Pollution is the reverse of
conservation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These three features of Nature – mobility, invisibility and silence –
are of profound significance to the economics of biodiversity</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is thus a tension between our demand for provisioning services
on the one hand and our need for regulating, maintenance, and cultural
services on the other. The distinction between drawing on Nature and
depending on Nature is all-important here. Tensions between the two
became manifest in recent centuries, but at the global scale it did so
only gradually. As we confirm below, it has become acute since the
middle of the 20th century.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Environmental externalities, for that is what we are focusing on
here, are prevalent because we do not have to pay for many of our
biosphere’s services. Being free, we demand too much; that is, we demand
more than is in our collective interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Governments almost everywhere amplify adverse environmental
externalities by paying people more to exploit the biosphere than they
do to protect it. These payments have been called perverse subsidies.
Examples include subsidies to agriculture, water, fossil fuels,
fisheries, energy and fertilisers. These subsidies encourage
over-extraction and harvesting of the biosphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ecosystems supplying those public goods differ from one another,
which means different remedies are required if their supply is to
improve. Consider that the world’s rainforests are a seat of global
public goods but fall within national jurisdictions. They thereby give
rise to unidirectional externalities. If we are to preserve the world’s
rainforests, the global community should be prepared to pay the nations
harbouring them to do that.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Protection of the oceans should therefore be subject to international
control (e.g. global taxation on ocean fisheries and transportation;
extensions of Protected Areas, and so on).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The social world can be as powerful a carrier of externalities as the
material environment. A common form in which they appear in the social
world is in the way our relationships influence our preferences and
wants. This is cause for hope that transitions to sustainable
development are possible and with lower human costs than may be
feared.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Advances in mapping the geographical spread of natural capital and in
methods to monitor its use can help enforce property rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The macroeconomic models of growth and development in use in economic
and finance ministries and Planning Commissions, however, do not
acknowledge that material must balance – from source to sink.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Models are now urgently needed that follow the ecological principles
outlined in the global economic model in the Review (Chapter 4*),
including data on natural capital. Empirical estimations of such models
are needed to address the question of whether, and for how long, the
redirection of consumption and investment that is now required is
compatible with global GDP growth in the immediate future.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For unidirectional externalities, payments by beneficiaries to those
holding property rights to ecosystems is an arrangement resembling
market operations. Named ‘Payments for Ecosystem Services’ (PES), the
underlying idea is simple enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Polycentric structures that are best placed to protect and promote
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> are thus layered institutions:
global, regional, national, and community based. Each layer requires an
authority at the apex to achieve coordination below and with other
layers laterally.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Standard economic measures such as GDP can mislead. If the goal is to
protect and promote well-being across the generations (i.e. social
well-being), governments should measure inclusive wealth (a measure of
societal means). Inclusive wealth is the sum of the accounting values of
produced capital, human capital, and natural capital.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Natural capital accounting is a necessary step towards the creation
of inclusive wealth accounts. It enables us to understand and appreciate
the place of Nature’s services in our economies, including the services
that are usually overlooked; it enables us to track the movement of
natural capital over time (a prerequisite for sustainability
assessment); and it offers us a way to estimate the impact of policies
on natural capital (a prerequisite for policy analysis).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Increased investment in physical accounts and in ecosystem valuation
would improve them. International cooperation in the construction of
national accounts and the sharing of data would improve decision-making
around the world. Harmonisation of national accounts should be coupled
with technical assistance. Incorporating natural capital accounts in
macroeconomic surveillance undertaken by international financial
institutions – for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Article IV
surveillance activities (IMF, 2020) – would also send a strong signal,
inspiring governments’ reform agendas to reflect the scale and urgency
of the problems societies face.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether we account for Nature in economic measures is key for how we
interpret productivity. Contemporary models of economic growth and
development tend only to consider produced and human capital as primary
factors of production, not explicitly natural capital.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither top-down nor bottom-up institutional structures work well.
What the inhabitant of an ecosystem knows and can observe differs from
what an agent from the national government knows and can observe.
Moreover, institutions that work well are neither entirely rigid nor
entirely flexible, they are both ‘polycentric’ and ‘layered’, meaning
that knowledge and perspectives at all levels from different
organisations, communities and individuals are pooled and spread.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Finance plays a crucial role. A significant portion of the
responsibility for helping us to shift course will fall on the global
financial system. Governments, central banks, international financial
institutions (such as Multilateral Development Banks) and private
financial institutions all have a role to play in making the shift.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To leave Nature alone so that it is able to thrive is to invest in
it. Governments have tools at their disposal to make that happen, even
if through indirect means. They range from taxes, subsidies, regulations
and prohibitions to Nature-specific mechanisms, such as payments for
ecosystem services (Box 13) and <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong>
offsetting schemes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Far more global support is needed for initiatives directed at
enhancing the understanding and awareness among financial institutions
of Nature-related financial risks, learning and building on the advances
on climate-related financial risks. Central banks and financial
supervisors can support this by assessing the systemic extent of
Nature-related financial risks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A set of global standards is required. They should be underpinned by
data that are both credible and useful for decision-making. Businesses
and financial institutions could then be obliged to integrate
Nature-related considerations with their other objectives. The idea
ultimately is to have them assess and disclose their use of natural
capital.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As citizens, we need to demand and shape the change we seek. We can
do this, for example, by insisting that financiers invest our money
sustainably, that firms disclose environmental conditions along their
supply chains (product labelling is a partial method for doing that),
even boycotting products that do not meet standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we are not acting now, it is because we have grown distant from
Nature. Such detachment is in part a symptom of societal change,
including growing urbanisation, the profusion of technology, and reduced
access to green spaces. Detachment from Nature has meant a loss in our
physical and emotional state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Establishing the natural world within educational policy would
contribute to countering the shifting baseline, whereby we progressively
redefine ourselves as inhabitants of an emptying world and believe that
what we see is how it is and how it will continue to be.</p>

The global Living Planet Index continues to decline. It shows an average
68% decrease in population sizes of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles
and fish between 1970 and 2016. A 94% decline in the LPI for the
tropical subregions of the Americas is the largest fall observed in any

<p>Using the data from 20,811 populations of 4,392 species, the 2020

1970 and 2016 (range: -73% to -62%).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The 94% decline in the LPI for the tropical subregions of the
Americas is the most striking result observed in any region. The
conversion of grasslands, savannahs, forests and wetlands, the
overexploitation of species, climate change, and the introduction of
alien species are key drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The 3,741 monitored populations – representing 944 species of
mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fishes – in the Freshwater
Living Planet Index have declined by an average of 84% (range: -89% to
-77%), equivalent to 4% per year since 1970. Species population trends
are important because they are a measure of overall ecosystem health.
Measuring biodiversity, the variety of all living things, is complex,
and there is no single measure that can capture all of the changes in
this web of life. Nevertheless, the vast majority of indicators show net
declines over recent decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the industrial revolution, human activities have increasingly
destroyed and degraded forests, grasslands, wetlands and other important
ecosystems, threatening human well-being. Seventy- five per cent of the
Earth’s ice-free land surface has already been significantly altered,
most of the oceans are polluted, and more than 85% of the area of
wetlands has been lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s because in the last 50 years our world has been transformed by
an explosion in global trade, consumption and human population growth,
as well as an enormous move towards urbanisation. Until 1970, humanity’s
Ecological Footprint was smaller than the Earth’s rate of regeneration.
To feed and fuel our 21st century lifestyles, we are overusing the
Earth’s biocapacity by at least 56%.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tigers, pandas and polar bears are well-known species in the story of
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> decline, but what of the millions
of tiny, or as-yet-undiscovered, species that are also under threat?
What is happening to the life in our soils, or in plant and insect
diversity? All of these provide fundamental support for life on Earth
and are showing signs of stress.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> threatens food security
and urgent action is needed to address the loss of the
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> that feeds the world. Where and
how we produce food is one of the biggest human-caused threats to nature
and our ecosystems, making the transformation of our global food system
more important than ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The challenge is to transform agricultural and fishing practices,
many of which are unsustainable today, into ones that produce the
affordable and nourishing food we need while protecting and conserving
biodiversity. For agriculture, this means using sustainable
agroecological practices, reducing the use of chemicals, fertilisers and
pesticides, and protecting our soils and pollinators.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Status of the World’s Soil Resources 33 concluded that the loss
of soil <strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> is considered one of the
major soil threats in many regions of the world. Some responses to bend
the curve of <strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong> include
sustainable use of soil genetic resources and improved soil management
to safeguard soil biota as well as its multiple functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Assessment of a sample of thousands of species representing the
taxonomic and geographic breadth of global plant diversity showed that
one in five (22%) are threatened with extinction, most of them in the
tropics 50. Plant extinction risk is comparable to that of mammals and
higher than for birds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is evidence of recent, rapid declines in insect abundance,
diversity and biomass, but the picture is complex and most evidence
comes from a few taxa and a few countries in the northern
hemisphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The transformation of our economic systems is also critical. Our
economies are embedded within nature, and it is only by recognising and
acting on this reality that we can protect and enhance
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> and improve our economic
prosperity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We can estimate the value of ‘natural capital’ – the planet’s stock
of renewable and non-renewable natural resources, like plants, soils and
minerals – alongside values of produced and human capital –for example,
roads and skills – which together form a measure of a country’s true
wealth. Data from the United Nations Environment Programme shows that,
per person, our global stock of natural capital has declined by nearly
40% since the early 1990s, while produced capital has doubled and human
capital has increased by 13%.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A key problem is the mismatch between the artificial ‘economic
grammar’ which drives public and private policy and ‘nature’s syntax’
which determines how the real world operates.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Together this evidence shows that
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> conservation is more than an
ethical commitment for humanity: it is a non-negotiable and strategic
investment to preserve our health, wealth and security.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we reverse these trends of decline? WWF co-founded a new research
initiative – the Bending the Curve Initiative – that has developed
pioneering modelling, providing a ‘proof of concept’ that we can halt,
and reverse, terrestrial <strong><em>biodiversity loss</em></strong>
from land-use change. And the models are all telling us the same thing:
that we still have an opportunity to flatten, and reverse, the loss of
nature if we take urgent and unprecedented conservation action and make
transformational changes in the way we produce and consume food.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Until now, decades of words and warnings have not changed modern
human society’s business-as-usual trajectory. Yet in times of rapid
upheaval and disruption new ideas, creativity, processes and
opportunities for transformation can arise. The future is always
uncertain but perhaps the COVID-19 pandemic will spur us on to embrace
this unexpected opportunity and revolutionise how we take care of our
home.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over 500,000 of the world’s estimated 5.9 million terrestrial species
have insufficient habitat for long term survival without habitat

<blockquote>
<p>Without such action, there will be a further acceleration in the

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The rate of global change in nature during the past 50 years is
unprecedented in human history.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The direct drivers of change in nature with the largest global impact
have been (starting with those with most impact): changes in land and
sea use; direct exploitation of organisms; climate change; pollution;
and invasion of alien species.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Those five direct drivers result from an array of underlying causes –
the indirect drivers of change – which are in turn underpinned by
societal values and behaviours that include production and consumption
patterns, human population dynamics and trends, trade, technological
innovations and local through global governance. The rate of change in
the direct and indirect drivers differs among regions and countries.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Climate change is projected to become increasingly important as a
direct driver of changes in nature and its contributions to people in

<blockquote>
<p>Economic incentives have generally favoured expanding economic
activity, and often environmental harm, over conservation or

ecosystem functions and of nature’s contributions to people into
economic incentives has, in the economy, been shown to permit better
ecological, economic and social outcomes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nature managed by indigenous peoples and local communities is under
increasing pressure. Nature is generally declining less rapidly in

and beyond may only be achieved through transformative changes across
economic, social, political and technological factors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Except in scenarios that include transformative change, negative
trends in nature, in ecosystem functions and in many of nature’s
contributions to people are projected to continue to 2050 and beyond,
due to the projected impacts of increasing land-/and sea-use change,
exploitation of organisms and climate change.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Societal goals, including those related to food, water, energy,
health and the achievement of human well-being for all, mitigating and
adapting to climate change and conserving and sustainably using nature,
can be achieved in sustainable pathways through the rapid and improved
deployment of existing policy instruments and new initiatives that more
effectively enlist individual and collective action for transformative
change.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since current structures often inhibit sustainable development and
actually represent the indirect drivers of <strong><em>biodiversity
loss</em></strong>, such fundamental, structural change is called for.
By its very nature, transformative change can expect opposition from
those with interests vested in the status quo, but such opposition can
be overcome for the broader public good.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If obstacles are overcome, a commitment to mutually supportive
international goals and targets, supporting actions by indigenous
peoples and local communities at the local level, new frameworks for
private sector investment and innovation, inclusive and adaptive
governance approaches and arrangements, multi-sectoral planning, and
strategic policy mixes can help to transform the public and private
sectors to achieve sustainability at the local, national and global
levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Five main interventions (“levers”) can generate transformative change
by tackling the underlying indirect drivers of the deterioration of
nature: (1) incentives and capacity-building; (2) cross-sectoral
cooperation; (3) pre-emptive action; (4) decision-making in the context
of resilience and uncertainty; and (5) environmental law and
implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The character and trajectories of transformation will vary across
contexts, with challenges and needs differing, among others, in
developing and developed countries. Risks related to the inevitable
uncertainties and complexities in transformations towards sustainability
can be reduced through governance approaches that are integrative,
inclusive, informed and adaptive.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Land-based climate change mitigation activities can be effective and
support conservation goals. However, the large-scale deployment of
bioenergy plantations and afforestation of non-forest ecosystems can
come with negative side effects for
<strong><em>biodiversity</em></strong> and ecosystem functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature-based solutions can be cost-effective for meeting the
Sustainable Development Goals in cities, which are crucial for global
sustainability.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A key component of sustainable pathways is the evolution of global
financial and economic systems to build a global sustainable economy,
steering away from the current, limited paradigm of economic growth.</p>

<blockquote>
Over the past 50 years, humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly and
extensively than in any comparable period of time in human history,
largely to meet rapidly growing demands for food, fresh water, timber,
fiber, and fuel. This has resulted in a sub-stantial and largely
irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth.
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The changes that have been made to ecosystems have contributed to
substantial net gains in human well-being and economic development, but
these gains have been achieved at growing costs in the form of the
degradation of many ecosystem services, increased risks of nonlinear
changes, and the exacerbation of poverty for some groups of people.
These problems, unless addressed, will substantially diminish the
benefits that future generations obtain from ecosystems.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The challenge of reversing the degradation of ecosystems while
meeting increasing demands for their services can be partially met under
some scenarios that the MA has considered, but these involve significant
changes in policies, institutions, and practices that are not currently
under way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Approximately 60% (15 out of 24) of the ecosystem services examined
during the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment are being degraded or used
unsustainably, including fresh water, capture fisheries, air and water
purification, and the regulation of regional and local climate, natural
hazards, and pests.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is established but incomplete evidence that changes being made
in ecosystems are increasing the likelihood of nonlinear changes in
ecosystems (including accelerating, abrupt, and potentially irreversible
changes) that have important consequences for human well-being.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Humans are fundamentally, and to a significant extent irreversibly,
changing the diversity of life on Earth, and most of these changes
represent a <strong><em>loss of biodiversity</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The harmful effects of the degradation of ecosystem services (the
persistent decrease in the capacity of an ecosystem to deliver services)
are being borne disproportionately by the poor, are contributing to
growing inequities and disparities across groups of people, and are
sometimes the principal factor causing poverty and social conflict.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More land was converted to cropland in the 30 years after 1950 than
in the 150 years between 1700 and 1850. Cultivated systems (areas where
at least 30% of the landscape is in crop-lands, shifting cultivation,
confined livestock production, or freshwater aquaculture) now cover one
quarter of Earth’s terrestrial surface.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The amount of water impounded behind dams quadrupled since 1960, and
three to six times as much water is held in reservoirs as in natural
rivers. Water withdrawals from rivers and lakes doubled since 1960; most
water use (70% worldwide) is for agriculture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 1960, flows of reactive (biologically available) nitrogen in
terrestrial ecosystems have doubled, and flows of phosphorus have
tripled. More than half of all the synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, which
was first manufactured in 1913, ever used on the planet has been used
since 1985.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 1750, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has
increased by about 32% (from about 280 to 376 parts per million in
2003), primarily due to the combustion of fossil fuels and land use
changes. Approximately 60% of that increase (60 parts per million) has
taken place since 1959.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More than two thirds of the area of 2 of the world’s 14 major
terrestrial biomes and more than half of the area of 4 other biomes had
been converted by 1990, primarily to agriculture.</p>
