<blockquote>
<p>Today we face the double, interlinked emergencies of human-induced
climate change and the loss of biodiversity, threatening the well-being
of current and future generations. As our future is critically dependent
on biodiversity and a stable climate, it is essential that we understand
how nature’s decline and climate change are connected.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Land-use change is still the biggest current threat to nature,
destroying or fragmenting the natural habitats of many plant and animal
species on land, in freshwater and in the sea. However, if we are unable
to limit warming to 1.5°C, climate change is likely to become the
dominant cause of biodiversity loss in the coming decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tracking the health of nature over almost 50 years, the Living Planet
Index acts as an early warning indicator by tracking trends in the
abundance of mammals, fish, reptiles, birds and amphibians around the
world. In its most comprehensive finding to date, this edition shows an
average 69% decline in the relative abundance of monitored wildlife
populations around the world between 1970 and 2018.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in average
population abundance (94%), while freshwater species populations have
seen the greatest overall global decline (83%).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We know that transformational change – game-changing shifts– will be
essential to put theory into practice. We need system-wide changes in
how we produce and consume, the technology we use, and our economic and
financial systems. Underpinning these changes must be a move from goals
and targets to values and rights, in policy-making and in day-to-day
life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A nature-positive future needs transformative - game changing -
shifts in how we produce, how we consume, how we govern, and what we
finance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Achieving net-zero loss for nature is certainly not enough; we need a
nature- or net-positive goal to restore nature and not simply halt its
loss. Firstly, because we have lost and continue to lose so much nature
at such a speed that we need this higher ambition.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Climate change and biodiversity loss are not only environmental
issues, but economic, development, security, social, moral and ethical
issues too – and they must therefore be addressed together along with
the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>

<label class="accordion-label" for="check2">IPBES-IPCC Biodiversity and
Climate Change Workshop Report (2021)</label>
<div class="accordion-content">
<blockquote>
<p>Climate change and biodiversity loss are two of the most pressing
issues of the Anthropocene. While there is recognition in both
scientific and policy-making circles that the two are interconnected, in
practice they are largely addressed in their own domains.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each issue has its own international Convention (the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological
Diversity), and each has an intergovernmental body which assesses
available knowledge (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) and the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
Services (IPBES)). This functional separation creates a risk of
incompletely identifying, understanding and dealing with the connections
between the two.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Increasing energy consumption, overexploitation of natural resources
and unprecedented transformation of land-, freshwater- and seascapes
over the past 150 years have paralleled technological advances and
supported better living standards for many but have also led to changes
in climate and the accelerating decline of biological diversity
worldwide, both negatively impacting many aspects of good quality of
life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To be holistically effective, renewable energy development will
benefit from consideration of a circular economy and, ultimately,
biodiversity</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The mutual reinforcing of climate change and biodiversity loss means
that satisfactorily resolving either issue requires consideration of the
other.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Avoiding and reversing the loss and degradation of carbon- and
species-rich ecosystems on land and in the ocean is of highest
importance for combined biodiversity protection and climate change
mitigation actions with large adaptation co-benefits.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Planting bioenergy crops (including trees, perennial grasses or
annual crops) in monocultures over a very large share of total land area
is detrimental to ecosystems, reduces supply of many other nature’s
contributions to people and impedes achievement of numerous Sustainable
Development Goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Technology-based measures that are effective for climate change
mitigation can pose serious threats to biodiversity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Changes in per capita consumption, shift in diets, and progress
towards sustainable exploitation of natural resources, including reduced
post-harvest waste, could make substantial contributions to addressing
the biodiversity crisis, climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Achieving the scale and scope of transformative change needed to meet
the goals of the UNFCCC and CBD and the Sustainable Development Goals
relies on rapid and far-reaching actions of a type never before
attempted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Human well-being critically depends on the Earth’s natural systems.
Yet the economic, technological and social advances have also led to a
reduction of the Earth’s capacity to sustain current and future human
well-being. Human prosperity relies on the wise use of the planet’s
finite space and remaining resources, as well as on the protection and
restoration of its life-supporting processes and capacity to absorb
waste.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The international community has set targets, informed by science, in
multi-lateral agreements for protecting natural assets and limiting
harmful environmental change. Despite some progress, efforts to date
have failed to meet any of the agreed targets.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Economic and financial systems fail to account for the essential
benefits that humanity gets from nature and to provide incentives to
manage nature wisely and maintain its value.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Climate change, loss of biodiversity, land degradation, and
accumulating chemicals and waste reinforce each other and are caused by
the same indirect drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As a result of the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services,
nature’s ability to support human health through regulation of air and
water quality is in decline in many places, as well as its ability to
provide opportunities for recreation and relaxation, which support
physical and mental health and well-being. Biodiversity loss is also
negatively affecting nature’s ability to supply medicines.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Global warming of more than 2°C combined with continued loss of
biodiversity and increasing pollution will likely have dire consequences
for humanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Only system-wide transformation will enable humanity to achieve
well-being for all within the Earth’s finite capacity to provide
resources and absorb human waste.</p>

<label class="accordion-label" for="check4">Dasgupta Review: The
Economics of Biodiversity (2021)</label>
<div class="accordion-content">
<blockquote>
<p>But like education and health, Nature is more than a mere economic
good. Nature nurtures and nourishes us, so we will think of assets as
durable entities that not only have use value, but may also have
intrinsic worth. Once we make that extension, the economics of
biodiversity becomes a study in portfolio management.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The damage inflicted on each type of asset (buildings, forests, the
atmosphere, fisheries, human health) should be interpreted as
depreciation of that asset. Pollution is the reverse of
conservation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These three features of Nature – mobility, invisibility and silence –
are of profound significance to the economics of biodiversity</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is thus a tension between our demand for provisioning services
on the one hand and our need for regulating, maintenance, and cultural
services on the other. The distinction between drawing on Nature and
depending on Nature is all-important here. Tensions between the two
became manifest in recent centuries, but at the global scale it did so
only gradually. As we confirm below, it has become acute since the
middle of the 20th century.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Environmental externalities, for that is what we are focusing on
here, are prevalent because we do not have to pay for many of our
biosphere’s services. Being free, we demand too much; that is, we demand
more than is in our collective interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Governments almost everywhere amplify adverse environmental
externalities by paying people more to exploit the biosphere than they
do to protect it. These payments have been called perverse subsidies.
Examples include subsidies to agriculture, water, fossil fuels,
fisheries, energy and fertilisers. These subsidies encourage
over-extraction and harvesting of the biosphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ecosystems supplying those public goods differ from one another,
which means different remedies are required if their supply is to
improve. Consider that the world’s rainforests are a seat of global
public goods but fall within national jurisdictions. They thereby give
rise to unidirectional externalities. If we are to preserve the world’s
rainforests, the global community should be prepared to pay the nations
harbouring them to do that.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Protection of the oceans should therefore be subject to international
control (e.g. global taxation on ocean fisheries and transportation;
extensions of Protected Areas, and so on).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The social world can be as powerful a carrier of externalities as the
material environment. A common form in which they appear in the social
world is in the way our relationships influence our preferences and
wants. This is cause for hope that transitions to sustainable
development are possible and with lower human costs than may be
feared.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Advances in mapping the geographical spread of natural capital and in
methods to monitor its use can help enforce property rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The macroeconomic models of growth and development in use in economic
and finance ministries and Planning Commissions, however, do not
acknowledge that material must balance – from source to sink.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Models are now urgently needed that follow the ecological principles
outlined in the global economic model in the Review (Chapter 4*),
including data on natural capital. Empirical estimations of such models
are needed to address the question of whether, and for how long, the
redirection of consumption and investment that is now required is
compatible with global GDP growth in the immediate future.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For unidirectional externalities, payments by beneficiaries to those
holding property rights to ecosystems is an arrangement resembling
market operations. Named ‘Payments for Ecosystem Services’ (PES), the
underlying idea is simple enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Polycentric structures that are best placed to protect and promote
biodiversity are thus layered institutions: global, regional, national,
and community based. Each layer requires an authority at the apex to
achieve coordination below and with other layers laterally.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Standard economic measures such as GDP can mislead. If the goal is to
protect and promote well-being across the generations (i.e. social
well-being), governments should measure inclusive wealth (a measure of
societal means). Inclusive wealth is the sum of the accounting values of
produced capital, human capital, and natural capital.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Natural capital accounting is a necessary step towards the creation
of inclusive wealth accounts. It enables us to understand and appreciate
the place of Nature’s services in our economies, including the services
that are usually overlooked; it enables us to track the movement of
natural capital over time (a prerequisite for sustainability
assessment); and it offers us a way to estimate the impact of policies
on natural capital (a prerequisite for policy analysis).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Increased investment in physical accounts and in ecosystem valuation
would improve them. International cooperation in the construction of
national accounts and the sharing of data would improve decision-making
around the world. Harmonisation of national accounts should be coupled
with technical assistance. Incorporating natural capital accounts in
macroeconomic surveillance undertaken by international financial
institutions – for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Article IV
surveillance activities (IMF, 2020) – would also send a strong signal,
inspiring governments’ reform agendas to reflect the scale and urgency
of the problems societies face.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether we account for Nature in economic measures is key for how we
interpret productivity. Contemporary models of economic growth and
development tend only to consider produced and human capital as primary
factors of production, not explicitly natural capital.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither top-down nor bottom-up institutional structures work well.
What the inhabitant of an ecosystem knows and can observe differs from
what an agent from the national government knows and can observe.
Moreover, institutions that work well are neither entirely rigid nor
entirely flexible, they are both ‘polycentric’ and ‘layered’, meaning
that knowledge and perspectives at all levels from different
organisations, communities and individuals are pooled and spread.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Finance plays a crucial role. A significant portion of the
responsibility for helping us to shift course will fall on the global
financial system. Governments, central banks, international financial
institutions (such as Multilateral Development Banks) and private
financial institutions all have a role to play in making the shift.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To leave Nature alone so that it is able to thrive is to invest in
it. Governments have tools at their disposal to make that happen, even
if through indirect means. They range from taxes, subsidies, regulations
and prohibitions to Nature-specific mechanisms, such as payments for
ecosystem services (Box 13) and biodiversity offsetting schemes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Far more global support is needed for initiatives directed at
enhancing the understanding and awareness among financial institutions
of Nature-related financial risks, learning and building on the advances
on climate-related financial risks. Central banks and financial
supervisors can support this by assessing the systemic extent of
Nature-related financial risks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A set of global standards is required. They should be underpinned by
data that are both credible and useful for decision-making. Businesses
and financial institutions could then be obliged to integrate
Nature-related considerations with their other objectives. The idea
ultimately is to have them assess and disclose their use of natural
capital.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As citizens, we need to demand and shape the change we seek. We can
do this, for example, by insisting that financiers invest our money
sustainably, that firms disclose environmental conditions along their
supply chains (product labelling is a partial method for doing that),
even boycotting products that do not meet standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we are not acting now, it is because we have grown distant from
Nature. Such detachment is in part a symptom of societal change,
including growing urbanisation, the profusion of technology, and reduced
access to green spaces. Detachment from Nature has meant a loss in our
physical and emotional state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Establishing the natural world within educational policy would
contribute to countering the shifting baseline, whereby we progressively
redefine ourselves as inhabitants of an emptying world and believe that
what we see is how it is and how it will continue to be.</p>

<p>Since the industrial revolution, human activities have increasingly
destroyed and degraded forests, grasslands, wetlands and other important
ecosystems, threatening human well-being. Seventy- five per cent of the
Earth’s ice-free land surface has already been significantly altered,
most of the oceans are polluted, and more than 85% of the area of
wetlands has been lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The challenge is to transform agricultural and fishing practices,
many of which are unsustainable today, into ones that produce the
affordable and nourishing food we need while protecting and conserving
biodiversity. For agriculture, this means using sustainable
agroecological practices, reducing the use of chemicals, fertilisers and
pesticides, and protecting our soils and pollinators.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the data from 20,811 populations of 4,392 species, the 2020
global LPI shows an average 68% decline in monitored populations between
1970 and 2016 (range: -73% to -62%).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The 94% decline in the LPI for the tropical subregions of the
Americas is the most striking result observed in any region. The
conversion of grasslands, savannahs, forests and wetlands, the
overexploitation of species, climate change, and the introduction of
alien species are key drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The 3,741 monitored populations – representing 944 species of
mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fishes – in the Freshwater
Living Planet Index have declined by an average of 84% (range: -89% to
-77%), equivalent to 4% per year since 1970.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Status of the World’s Soil Resources 33 concluded that the loss
of soil biodiversity is considered one of the major soil threats in many
regions of the world. Some responses to bend the curve of biodiversity
loss include sustainable use of soil genetic resources and improved soil
management to safeguard soil biota as well as its multiple
functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Assessment of a sample of thousands of species representing the
taxonomic and geographic breadth of global plant diversity showed that
one in five (22%) are threatened with extinction, most of them in the
tropics 50. Plant extinction risk is comparable to that of mammals and
higher than for birds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is evidence of recent, rapid declines in insect abundance,
diversity and biomass, but the picture is complex and most evidence
comes from a few taxa and a few countries in the northern
hemisphere.</p>

wetlands is currently three times faster, in percentage terms, than

<blockquote>
<p>Over the past 50 years, humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly
and extensively than in any comparable period of time in human history,
largely to meet rapidly growing demands for food, fresh water, timber,
fiber, and fuel. This has resulted in a sub-stantial and largely
irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Approximately 60% (15 out of 24) of the ecosystem services examined
during the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment are being degraded or used
unsustainably, including fresh water, capture fisheries, air and water
purification, and the regulation of regional and local climate, natural
hazards, and pests.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is established but incomplete evidence that changes being made
in ecosystems are increasing the likelihood of nonlinear changes in
ecosystems (including accelerating, abrupt, and potentially irreversible
changes) that have important consequences for human well-being.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Humans are fundamentally, and to a significant extent irreversibly,
changing the diversity of life on Earth, and most of these changes
represent a loss of biodiversity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The harmful effects of the degradation of ecosystem services (the
persistent decrease in the capacity of an ecosystem to deliver services)
are being borne disproportionately by the poor, are contributing to
growing inequities and disparities across groups of people, and are
sometimes the principal factor causing poverty and social conflict.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More land was converted to cropland in the 30 years after 1950 than
in the 150 years between 1700 and 1850. Cultivated systems (areas where
at least 30% of the landscape is in crop-lands, shifting cultivation,
confined livestock production, or freshwater aquaculture) now cover one
quarter of Earth’s terrestrial surface.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The amount of water impounded behind dams quadrupled since 1960, and
three to six times as much water is held in reservoirs as in natural
rivers. Water withdrawals from rivers and lakes doubled since 1960; most
water use (70% worldwide) is for agriculture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 1960, flows of reactive (biologically available) nitrogen in
terrestrial ecosystems have doubled, and flows of phosphorus have
tripled. More than half of all the synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, which
was first manufactured in 1913, ever used on the planet has been used
since 1985.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 1750, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has
increased by about 32% (from about 280 to 376 parts per million in
2003), primarily due to the combustion of fossil fuels and land use
changes. Approximately 60% of that increase (60 parts per million) has
taken place since 1959.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More than two thirds of the area of 2 of the world’s 14 major
terrestrial biomes and more than half of the area of 4 other biomes had
been converted by 1990, primarily to agriculture.</p>
