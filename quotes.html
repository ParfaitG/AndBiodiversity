<blockquote>
<p>Today we face the double, interlinked emergencies of human-induced
climate change and the loss of biodiversity, threatening the well-being
of current and future generations. As our future is critically dependent
on biodiversity and a stable climate, it is essential that we understand
how nature’s decline and climate change are connected.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Land-use change is still the biggest current threat to nature,
destroying or fragmenting the natural habitats of many plant and animal
species on land, in freshwater and in the sea. However, if we are unable
to limit warming to 1.5°C, climate change is likely to become the
dominant cause of biodiversity loss in the coming decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tracking the health of nature over almost 50 years, the Living Planet
Index acts as an early warning indicator by tracking trends in the
abundance of mammals, fish, reptiles, birds and amphibians around the
world. In its most comprehensive finding to date, this edition shows an
average 69% decline in the relative abundance of monitored wildlife
populations around the world between 1970 and 2018.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Latin America shows the greatest regional decline in average
population abundance (94%), while freshwater species populations have
seen the greatest overall global decline (83%).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We know that transformational change – game-changing shifts– will be
essential to put theory into practice. We need system-wide changes in
how we produce and consume, the technology we use, and our economic and
financial systems. Underpinning these changes must be a move from goals
and targets to values and rights, in policy-making and in day-to-day
life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A nature-positive future needs transformative - game changing -
shifts in how we produce, how we consume, how we govern, and what we
finance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Achieving net-zero loss for nature is certainly not enough; we need a
nature- or net-positive goal to restore nature and not simply halt its
loss. Firstly, because we have lost and continue to lose so much nature
at such a speed that we need this higher ambition.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Climate change and biodiversity loss are not only environmental
issues, but economic, development, security, social, moral and ethical
issues too – and they must therefore be addressed together along with
the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p>

<label class="accordion-label" for="check2">IPBES-IPCC Biodiversity and
Climate Change Workshop Report (2021)</label>
<div class="accordion-content">
<blockquote>
<p>Climate change and biodiversity loss are two of the most pressing
issues of the Anthropocene. While there is recognition in both
scientific and policy-making circles that the two are interconnected, in
practice they are largely addressed in their own domains.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Each issue has its own international Convention (the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological
Diversity), and each has an intergovernmental body which assesses
available knowledge (the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) and the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
Services (IPBES)). This functional separation creates a risk of
incompletely identifying, understanding and dealing with the connections
between the two.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Increasing energy consumption, overexploitation of natural resources
and unprecedented transformation of land-, freshwater- and seascapes
over the past 150 years have paralleled technological advances and
supported better living standards for many but have also led to changes
in climate and the accelerating decline of biological diversity
worldwide, both negatively impacting many aspects of good quality of
life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To be holistically effective, renewable energy development will
benefit from consideration of a circular economy and, ultimately,
biodiversity</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The mutual reinforcing of climate change and biodiversity loss means
that satisfactorily resolving either issue requires consideration of the
other.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These interactions can generate complex feedbacks between climate,
biodiversity and humans that may produce more pronounced and less
predictable outcomes. Ignoring the inseparable nature of climate,
biodiversity, and human quality of life will result in non-optimal
solutions to either crisis.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Previous policies have largely tackled the problems of climate change
and biodiversity loss independently. Policies that simultaneously
address synergies between mitigating biodiversity loss and climate
change, while also considering their societal impacts, offer the
opportunity to maximize co-benefits and help meet development
aspirations for all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cross-cutting issues, intersectoral policies and regulatory
frameworks are areas where strong synergies could contribute to the
transformative societal change that is needed to achieve ambitious goals
for biodiversity, climate mitigation and good quality of life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In a world increasingly affected by climate change, maintaining
biodiversity relies on enhanced and well-targeted conservation efforts,
coordinated with and supported by strong adaptation and innovation
efforts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A new conservation paradigm would address the simultaneous objectives
of a habitable climate, self-sustaining biodiversity, and a good quality
of life for all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature-based solutions (NbS) can play an important role in climate
mitigation, but the extent is debated, and they can only be effective
with ambitious reductions in all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.
Nature-based solutions can be most effective when planned for longevity
and not narrowly focussed on rapid carbon sequestration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Avoiding and reversing the loss and degradation of carbon- and
species-rich ecosystems on land and in the ocean is of highest
importance for combined biodiversity protection and climate change
mitigation actions with large adaptation co-benefits.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sustainable agricultural and forestry practices can improve adaptive
capacity, enhance biodiversity, increase carbon storage in farmland and
forest soils and vegetation, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The creation of green infrastructure in cities is increasingly being
used for climate change adaptation and restoration of biodiversity with
climate mitigation co-benefits.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In both land and marine systems, options exist to combine
nature-based and technology-based measures for climate change mitigation
and adaptation, while contributing to biodiversity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important that the full climate consequences of land-based
climate mitigation actions, in both the short and long-term are
considered when evaluating their contribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Planting bioenergy crops (including trees, perennial grasses or
annual crops) in monocultures over a very large share of total land area
is detrimental to ecosystems, reduces supply of many other nature’s
contributions to people and impedes achievement of numerous Sustainable
Development Goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Afforestation, which involves planting trees in ecosystems that have
not historically been forests, and reforestation with monocultures,
especially with exotic tree species, can contribute to climate change
mitigation but are often detrimental to biodiversity and do not have
clear benefits for adaptation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Technology-based measures that are effective for climate change
mitigation can pose serious threats to biodiversity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Measures intended to facilitate adaptation to one aspect of climate
change without considering other aspects of sustainability may in
practice be maladaptive and result in unforeseen detrimental
outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Measures narrowly focusing on protection and restoration of
biodiversity have generally important knock-on benefits for climate
change mitigation, but those benefits may be sub-optimal compared to
measures that account for both biodiversity and climate.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Changes in per capita consumption, shift in diets, and progress
towards sustainable exploitation of natural resources, including reduced
post-harvest waste, could make substantial contributions to addressing
the biodiversity crisis, climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Treating climate, biodiversity and human society as coupled systems
is key to successful outcomes from policy interventions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The explicit consideration of the interactions between biodiversity,
climate and society in policy decisions provides opportunities to
maximize co-benefits and to minimize trade-offs and co-detrimental
(mutually harmful) effects for people and nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When considering biodiversity-climate-society interactions, it is
important to examine how the linkages between policy decisions and
consequences unfold over time and how they act beyond the specific
spatial context.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Assessing the range of viable solutions (‘solution space’) to achieve
the intended climate mitigation, adaptation and biodiversity
conservation outcomes, while positively contributing to people’s quality
of life, requires recognition of differences in social-ecological
contexts.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Transformative change in governance of socio-ecological systems can
help create climate and biodiversity resilient development pathways.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Existing governance systems often lack effective mechanisms to
improve integration between climate and biodiversity, and between
international and national to subnational scales.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall, mainstreaming of biodiversity into climate policy and vice
versa, and of both into initiatives to advance human development and
good quality of life, remains limited at many scales and in many
sectors, although there are some promising initiatives emerging, such as
jurisdictional approaches, experimental policy mixes, and rights-based
approaches.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A key outcome for successfully integrated governance of climate,
biodiversity and good quality of life will be to help identify solutions
for stewardship that deliver the highest co-benefits while avoiding
trade-offs.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Multi-actor and multi-scale governance are appropriate approaches to
the management of multifunctional ‘scapes’ at different scales.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The imperative for rapid action on both climate change and
biodiversity loss argues for governance models to move beyond
state-based approaches to embrace more collaborative solutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Transformative change can occur using leverage points in
socio-ecological systems which alter future trajectories. Critical
leverage points include exploring alternative visions of good quality of
life, rethinking consumption and waste, shifting values related to the
human-nature relationship, reducing inequalities, and promoting
education and learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Better tools for multi-sectoral scenario planning and modelling can
help map pathways to simultaneously achieve the goals in the SDGs, the
Paris Agreement and the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework in the
medium and long term.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Achieving the scale and scope of transformative change needed to meet
the goals of the UNFCCC and CBD and the Sustainable Development Goals
relies on rapid and far-reaching actions of a type never before
attempted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It includes new integrative agendas aligning all actors, private to
public, in support of actions to protect biodiversity, reduce the
impacts of climate change, and achieve sustainable development.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Transformative change elements identified can include effective
incentives and capacity-building, improved cooperation across sectors
and jurisdictions, anticipatory and pre-emptive actions, inclusive and
adaptive decision-making, and strengthened environmental policy and
implementation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Humanity’s environmental challenges have grown in number and severity
ever since the Stockholm Conference in 1972 and now represent a
planetary emergency.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Earth’s environmental emergencies and human well-being need to be
addressed together to achieve sustainability. The development of the
goals, targets, commitments and mechanisms under the key environmental
conventions and their implementation need to be aligned to become more
synergistic and effective.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The economic, financial and productive systems can and should be
transformed to lead and power the shift to sustainability. Society needs
to include natural capital in decision-making, eliminate environmentally
harmful subsidies and invest in the transition to a sustainable
future.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone has a role to play in ensuring that human knowledge,
ingenuity, technology and cooperation are redeployed from transforming
nature to transforming humankind‘s relationship with nature. Polycentric
governance is key to empowering people to express themselves and act
environmentally responsibly without undue difficulty or
self-sacrifice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Human well-being critically depends on the Earth’s natural systems.
Yet the economic, technological and social advances have also led to a
reduction of the Earth’s capacity to sustain current and future human
well-being. Human prosperity relies on the wise use of the planet’s
finite space and remaining resources, as well as on the protection and
restoration of its life-supporting processes and capacity to absorb
waste.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last 50 years, the global economy has grown nearly fivefold,
due largely to a tripling in extraction of natural resources and energy
that has fuelled growth in production and consumption.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The increasingly unequal and resource-intensive model of development
drives environmental decline through climate change, biodiversity loss
and other forms of pollution and resource degradation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The international community has set targets, informed by science, in
multi-lateral agreements for protecting natural assets and limiting
harmful environmental change. Despite some progress, efforts to date
have failed to meet any of the agreed targets.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Economic and financial systems fail to account for the essential
benefits that humanity gets from nature and to provide incentives to
manage nature wisely and maintain its value.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Climate change, loss of biodiversity, land degradation, and
accumulating chemicals and waste reinforce each other and are caused by
the same indirect drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As a result of the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services,
nature’s ability to support human health through regulation of air and
water quality is in decline in many places, as well as its ability to
provide opportunities for recreation and relaxation, which support
physical and mental health and well-being. Biodiversity loss is also
negatively affecting nature’s ability to supply medicines.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Global warming of more than 2°C combined with continued loss of
biodiversity and increasing pollution will likely have dire consequences
for humanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Decades of incremental efforts have not stemmed the environmental
decline resulting from an expansive development model because vested and
short-term interests often prevail.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Only system-wide transformation will enable humanity to achieve
well-being for all within the Earth’s finite capacity to provide
resources and absorb human waste. This transformation will involve a
fundamental change in the technological, economic and social
organization of society, including world views, norms, values and
governance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the interconnected nature of climate change, loss of
biodiversity, land degradation, and air and water pollution, it is
essential that these problems are tackled together. Response options
that address multiple issues can mitigate multidimensional
vulnerability, minimize trade-offs and maximize synergies.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The loss of biodiversity can only be halted and reversed by providing
space dedicated for nature while also addressing drivers such as
changing land and sea use, overexploitation, climate change, pollution
and invasive alien species.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The adverse effects of chemicals and waste on the environment and
human health can be substantially reduced by implementing existing
international chemicals conventions. Further progress will require
strengthening the science-policy interface as the basis for
evidence-based policymaking and improved management systems, along with
legal and regulatory reform.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Governments should incorporate full natural capital accounting into
their decision-making and use policies and regulatory frameworks to
provide incentives for businesses to do the same. Yardsticks such as
inclusive wealth (the sum of produced, natural, human and social
capital) provide a better basis for investment decisions than gross
domestic product, as they reflect the capacity of current and future
generations to achieve and sustain higher living standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Changes in global patterns of consumption are critical to
transforming food, water and energy systems, and to challenging social
norms and business practices. Improving access to safe, nutritious and
affordable food for all, while reducing food waste and changing dietary
choices and consumer behaviour in high-income countries and groups, is
central for the achievement of hunger, biodiversity, waste and climate
goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cities and other settlements, especially rapidly expanding urban
areas and informal settlements, must be made more sustainable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>All actors have individual, complementary and nested roles to play in
bringing about cross-sectoral and economy-wide transformative change
with immediate and long-term impact. This can be enhanced through
capacity-building and education.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Governments initiate and lead in intergovernmental cooperation,
policies and legislation that transform society and the economy. Such
transformations enable the private sector, financial institutions,
labour organizations, scientific and educational bodies and media as
well as households and civil society groups to initiate and lead
transformations in their domains.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Individuals can facilitate transformation by, for instance,
exercising their voting and civic rights, changing their diets and
travel habits, avoiding waste of food and resources, and reducing their
consumption of water and energy. They can also promote behavioural
change by raising awareness in their communities. Human cooperation,
innovation and knowledge-sharing will create new social and economic
possibilities and opportunities in the transformation to a sustainable
future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But like education and health, Nature is more than a mere economic
good. Nature nurtures and nourishes us, so we will think of assets as
durable entities that not only have use value, but may also have
intrinsic worth. Once we make that extension, the economics of
biodiversity becomes a study in portfolio management.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The damage inflicted on each type of asset (buildings, forests, the
atmosphere, fisheries, human health) should be interpreted as
depreciation of that asset. Pollution is the reverse of
conservation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These three features of Nature – mobility, invisibility and silence –
are of profound significance to the economics of biodiversity</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is thus a tension between our demand for provisioning services
on the one hand and our need for regulating, maintenance, and cultural
services on the other. The distinction between drawing on Nature and
depending on Nature is all-important here. Tensions between the two
became manifest in recent centuries, but at the global scale it did so
only gradually. As we confirm below, it has become acute since the
middle of the 20th century.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Environmental externalities, for that is what we are focusing on
here, are prevalent because we do not have to pay for many of our
biosphere’s services. Being free, we demand too much; that is, we demand
more than is in our collective interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Governments almost everywhere amplify adverse environmental
externalities by paying people more to exploit the biosphere than they
do to protect it. These payments have been called perverse subsidies.
Examples include subsidies to agriculture, water, fossil fuels,
fisheries, energy and fertilisers. These subsidies encourage
over-extraction and harvesting of the biosphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The ecosystems supplying those public goods differ from one another,
which means different remedies are required if their supply is to
improve. Consider that the world’s rainforests are a seat of global
public goods but fall within national jurisdictions. They thereby give
rise to unidirectional externalities. If we are to preserve the world’s
rainforests, the global community should be prepared to pay the nations
harbouring them to do that.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Protection of the oceans should therefore be subject to international
control (e.g. global taxation on ocean fisheries and transportation;
extensions of Protected Areas, and so on).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The social world can be as powerful a carrier of externalities as the
material environment. A common form in which they appear in the social
world is in the way our relationships influence our preferences and
wants. This is cause for hope that transitions to sustainable
development are possible and with lower human costs than may be
feared.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Advances in mapping the geographical spread of natural capital and in
methods to monitor its use can help enforce property rights.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The macroeconomic models of growth and development in use in economic
and finance ministries and Planning Commissions, however, do not
acknowledge that material must balance – from source to sink.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Models are now urgently needed that follow the ecological principles
outlined in the global economic model in the Review (Chapter 4*),
including data on natural capital. Empirical estimations of such models
are needed to address the question of whether, and for how long, the
redirection of consumption and investment that is now required is
compatible with global GDP growth in the immediate future.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For unidirectional externalities, payments by beneficiaries to those
holding property rights to ecosystems is an arrangement resembling
market operations. Named ‘Payments for Ecosystem Services’ (PES), the
underlying idea is simple enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Polycentric structures that are best placed to protect and promote
biodiversity are thus layered institutions: global, regional, national,
and community based. Each layer requires an authority at the apex to
achieve coordination below and with other layers laterally.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Standard economic measures such as GDP can mislead. If the goal is to
protect and promote well-being across the generations (i.e. social
well-being), governments should measure inclusive wealth (a measure of
societal means). Inclusive wealth is the sum of the accounting values of
produced capital, human capital, and natural capital.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Natural capital accounting is a necessary step towards the creation
of inclusive wealth accounts. It enables us to understand and appreciate
the place of Nature’s services in our economies, including the services
that are usually overlooked; it enables us to track the movement of
natural capital over time (a prerequisite for sustainability
assessment); and it offers us a way to estimate the impact of policies
on natural capital (a prerequisite for policy analysis).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Increased investment in physical accounts and in ecosystem valuation
would improve them. International cooperation in the construction of
national accounts and the sharing of data would improve decision-making
around the world. Harmonisation of national accounts should be coupled
with technical assistance. Incorporating natural capital accounts in
macroeconomic surveillance undertaken by international financial
institutions – for example, the International Monetary Fund’s Article IV
surveillance activities (IMF, 2020) – would also send a strong signal,
inspiring governments’ reform agendas to reflect the scale and urgency
of the problems societies face.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether we account for Nature in economic measures is key for how we
interpret productivity. Contemporary models of economic growth and
development tend only to consider produced and human capital as primary
factors of production, not explicitly natural capital.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither top-down nor bottom-up institutional structures work well.
What the inhabitant of an ecosystem knows and can observe differs from
what an agent from the national government knows and can observe.
Moreover, institutions that work well are neither entirely rigid nor
entirely flexible, they are both ‘polycentric’ and ‘layered’, meaning
that knowledge and perspectives at all levels from different
organisations, communities and individuals are pooled and spread.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Finance plays a crucial role. A significant portion of the
responsibility for helping us to shift course will fall on the global
financial system. Governments, central banks, international financial
institutions (such as Multilateral Development Banks) and private
financial institutions all have a role to play in making the shift.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To leave Nature alone so that it is able to thrive is to invest in
it. Governments have tools at their disposal to make that happen, even
if through indirect means. They range from taxes, subsidies, regulations
and prohibitions to Nature-specific mechanisms, such as payments for
ecosystem services (Box 13) and biodiversity offsetting schemes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Far more global support is needed for initiatives directed at
enhancing the understanding and awareness among financial institutions
of Nature-related financial risks, learning and building on the advances
on climate-related financial risks. Central banks and financial
supervisors can support this by assessing the systemic extent of
Nature-related financial risks.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A set of global standards is required. They should be underpinned by
data that are both credible and useful for decision-making. Businesses
and financial institutions could then be obliged to integrate
Nature-related considerations with their other objectives. The idea
ultimately is to have them assess and disclose their use of natural
capital.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As citizens, we need to demand and shape the change we seek. We can
do this, for example, by insisting that financiers invest our money
sustainably, that firms disclose environmental conditions along their
supply chains (product labelling is a partial method for doing that),
even boycotting products that do not meet standards.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If we are not acting now, it is because we have grown distant from
Nature. Such detachment is in part a symptom of societal change,
including growing urbanisation, the profusion of technology, and reduced
access to green spaces. Detachment from Nature has meant a loss in our
physical and emotional state.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Establishing the natural world within educational policy would
contribute to countering the shifting baseline, whereby we progressively
redefine ourselves as inhabitants of an emptying world and believe that
what we see is how it is and how it will continue to be.</p>

<p>The global Living Planet Index continues to decline. It shows an
average 68% decrease in population sizes of mammals, birds, amphibians,
reptiles and fish between 1970 and 2016. A 94% decline in the LPI for
the tropical subregions of the Americas is the largest fall observed in
any part of the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the data from 20,811 populations of 4,392 species, the 2020
global LPI shows an average 68% decline in monitored populations between
1970 and 2016 (range: -73% to -62%).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The 94% decline in the LPI for the tropical subregions of the
Americas is the most striking result observed in any region. The
conversion of grasslands, savannahs, forests and wetlands, the
overexploitation of species, climate change, and the introduction of
alien species are key drivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The 3,741 monitored populations – representing 944 species of
mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fishes – in the Freshwater
Living Planet Index have declined by an average of 84% (range: -89% to
-77%), equivalent to 4% per year since 1970. Species population trends
are important because they are a measure of overall ecosystem health.
Measuring biodiversity, the variety of all living things, is complex,
and there is no single measure that can capture all of the changes in
this web of life. Nevertheless, the vast majority of indicators show net
declines over recent decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the industrial revolution, human activities have increasingly
destroyed and degraded forests, grasslands, wetlands and other important
ecosystems, threatening human well-being. Seventy- five per cent of the
Earth’s ice-free land surface has already been significantly altered,
most of the oceans are polluted, and more than 85% of the area of
wetlands has been lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That’s because in the last 50 years our world has been transformed by
an explosion in global trade, consumption and human population growth,
as well as an enormous move towards urbanisation. Until 1970, humanity’s
Ecological Footprint was smaller than the Earth’s rate of regeneration.
To feed and fuel our 21st century lifestyles, we are overusing the
Earth’s biocapacity by at least 56%.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Tigers, pandas and polar bears are well-known species in the story of
biodiversity decline, but what of the millions of tiny, or
as-yet-undiscovered, species that are also under threat? What is
happening to the life in our soils, or in plant and insect diversity?
All of these provide fundamental support for life on Earth and are
showing signs of stress.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Biodiversity loss threatens food security and urgent action is needed
to address the loss of the biodiversity that feeds the world. Where and
how we produce food is one of the biggest human-caused threats to nature
and our ecosystems, making the transformation of our global food system
more important than ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The challenge is to transform agricultural and fishing practices,
many of which are unsustainable today, into ones that produce the
affordable and nourishing food we need while protecting and conserving
biodiversity. For agriculture, this means using sustainable
agroecological practices, reducing the use of chemicals, fertilisers and
pesticides, and protecting our soils and pollinators.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Status of the World’s Soil Resources 33 concluded that the loss
of soil biodiversity is considered one of the major soil threats in many
regions of the world. Some responses to bend the curve of biodiversity
loss include sustainable use of soil genetic resources and improved soil
management to safeguard soil biota as well as its multiple
functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Assessment of a sample of thousands of species representing the
taxonomic and geographic breadth of global plant diversity showed that
one in five (22%) are threatened with extinction, most of them in the
tropics 50. Plant extinction risk is comparable to that of mammals and
higher than for birds.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is evidence of recent, rapid declines in insect abundance,
diversity and biomass, but the picture is complex and most evidence
comes from a few taxa and a few countries in the northern
hemisphere.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The transformation of our economic systems is also critical. Our
economies are embedded within nature, and it is only by recognising and
acting on this reality that we can protect and enhance biodiversity and
improve our economic prosperity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We can estimate the value of ‘natural capital’ – the planet’s stock
of renewable and non-renewable natural resources, like plants, soils and
minerals – alongside values of produced and human capital –for example,
roads and skills – which together form a measure of a country’s true
wealth. Data from the United Nations Environment Programme shows that,
per person, our global stock of natural capital has declined by nearly
40% since the early 1990s, while produced capital has doubled and human
capital has increased by 13%.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A key problem is the mismatch between the artificial ‘economic
grammar’ which drives public and private policy and ‘nature’s syntax’
which determines how the real world operates.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Together this evidence shows that biodiversity conservation is more
than an ethical commitment for humanity: it is a non-negotiable and
strategic investment to preserve our health, wealth and security.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we reverse these trends of decline? WWF co-founded a new research
initiative – the Bending the Curve Initiative – that has developed
pioneering modelling, providing a ‘proof of concept’ that we can halt,
and reverse, terrestrial biodiversity loss from land-use change. And the
models are all telling us the same thing: that we still have an
opportunity to flatten, and reverse, the loss of nature if we take
urgent and unprecedented conservation action and make transformational
changes in the way we produce and consume food.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Until now, decades of words and warnings have not changed modern
human society’s business-as-usual trajectory. Yet in times of rapid
upheaval and disruption new ideas, creativity, processes and
opportunities for transformation can arise. The future is always
uncertain but perhaps the COVID-19 pandemic will spur us on to embrace
this unexpected opportunity and revolutionise how we take care of our
home.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The biosphere, upon which humanity as a whole depends, is being
altered to an unparalleled degree across all spatial scales.
Biodiversity– the diversity within species, between species and of
ecosystems – is declining faster than at any time in human history.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 1970, trends in agricultural production, fish harvest,
bioenergy production and harvest of materials have increased, but 14 of
the 18 categories of contributions of nature that were assessed, mostly
regulating and non-material contributions, have declined.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature across most of the globe has now been significantly altered by
multiple human drivers, with the great majority of indicators of
ecosystems and biodiversity showing rapid decline.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An average of around 25 per cent of species in assessed animal and
plant groups are threatened, suggesting that around 1 million species
already face extinction, many within decades, unless action is taken to
reduce the intensity of drivers of biodiversity loss.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>75% of terrestrial environment (66% of marine environment) “severely
altered” to date by human actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>300-400 million tons of heavy metals, solvents, toxic sludge and
other wastes from industrial facilities are dumped annually into the
world’s waters.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>85% of wetlands present in 1700 had been lost by 2000 where loss of
wetlands is currently three times faster, in percentage terms, than
forest loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Average abundance of native species in most major land-based habitats
has fallen by at least 20%, mostly since 1900.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Population sizes of wild vertebrate species have tended to decline
over the last 50 years on land, in freshwater and in the sea.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost 33% of reef forming corals, sharks and shark relatives, and
over 33% marine mammals threatened with extinction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Over 500,000 of the world’s estimated 5.9 million terrestrial species
have insufficient habitat for long term survival without habitat
restoration.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Without such action, there will be a further acceleration in the
global rate of species extinction, which is already at least tens to
hundreds of times higher than it has averaged over the past 10 million
years.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The rate of global change in nature during the past 50 years is
unprecedented in human history.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The direct drivers of change in nature with the largest global impact
have been (starting with those with most impact): changes in land and
sea use; direct exploitation of organisms; climate change; pollution;
and invasion of alien species.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Those five direct drivers result from an array of underlying causes –
the indirect drivers of change – which are in turn underpinned by
societal values and behaviours that include production and consumption
patterns, human population dynamics and trends, trade, technological
innovations and local through global governance. The rate of change in
the direct and indirect drivers differs among regions and countries.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Climate change is a direct driver that is increasingly exacerbating
the impact of other drivers on nature and human well-being.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Climate change is projected to become increasingly important as a
direct driver of changes in nature and its contributions to people in
the next decades.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Economic incentives have generally favoured expanding economic
activity, and often environmental harm, over conservation or
restoration. Incorporating the consideration of the multiple values of
ecosystem functions and of nature’s contributions to people into
economic incentives has, in the economy, been shown to permit better
ecological, economic and social outcomes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature managed by indigenous peoples and local communities is under
increasing pressure. Nature is generally declining less rapidly in
indigenous peoples’ land than in other lands, but is nevertheless
declining, as is the knowledge of how to manage it. At least a quarter
of the global land area is traditionally owned, managed, used or
occupied by indigenous peoples.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Goals for conserving and sustainably using nature and achieving
sustainability cannot be met by current trajectories, and goals for 2030
and beyond may only be achieved through transformative changes across
economic, social, political and technological factors.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Past and ongoing rapid declines in biodiversity, ecosystem functions
and many of nature’s contributions to people mean that most
international societal and environmental goals, such as those embodied
in the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, will not be achieved based on current trajectories.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The negative trends in biodiversity and ecosystem functions are
projected to continue or worsen in many future scenarios in response to
indirect drivers such as rapid human population growth, unsustainable
production and consumption and associated technological development.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Except in scenarios that include transformative change, negative
trends in nature, in ecosystem functions and in many of nature’s
contributions to people are projected to continue to 2050 and beyond,
due to the projected impacts of increasing land-/and sea-use change,
exploitation of organisms and climate change.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Societal goals, including those related to food, water, energy,
health and the achievement of human well-being for all, mitigating and
adapting to climate change and conserving and sustainably using nature,
can be achieved in sustainable pathways through the rapid and improved
deployment of existing policy instruments and new initiatives that more
effectively enlist individual and collective action for transformative
change.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since current structures often inhibit sustainable development and
actually represent the indirect drivers of biodiversity loss, such
fundamental, structural change is called for. By its very nature,
transformative change can expect opposition from those with interests
vested in the status quo, but such opposition can be overcome for the
broader public good.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If obstacles are overcome, a commitment to mutually supportive
international goals and targets, supporting actions by indigenous
peoples and local communities at the local level, new frameworks for
private sector investment and innovation, inclusive and adaptive
governance approaches and arrangements, multi-sectoral planning, and
strategic policy mixes can help to transform the public and private
sectors to achieve sustainability at the local, national and global
levels.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Five main interventions (“levers”) can generate transformative change
by tackling the underlying indirect drivers of the deterioration of
nature: (1) incentives and capacity-building; (2) cross-sectoral
cooperation; (3) pre-emptive action; (4) decision-making in the context
of resilience and uncertainty; and (5) environmental law and
implementation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The character and trajectories of transformation will vary across
contexts, with challenges and needs differing, among others, in
developing and developed countries. Risks related to the inevitable
uncertainties and complexities in transformations towards sustainability
can be reduced through governance approaches that are integrative,
inclusive, informed and adaptive.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Land-based climate change mitigation activities can be effective and
support conservation goals. However, the large-scale deployment of
bioenergy plantations and afforestation of non-forest ecosystems can
come with negative side effects for biodiversity and ecosystem
functions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature-based solutions can be cost-effective for meeting the
Sustainable Development Goals in cities, which are crucial for global
sustainability.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A key component of sustainable pathways is the evolution of global
financial and economic systems to build a global sustainable economy,
steering away from the current, limited paradigm of economic growth.</p>

<p>Over the past 50 years, humans have changed ecosystems more rapidly
and extensively than in any comparable period of time in human history,
largely to meet rapidly growing demands for food, fresh water, timber,
fiber, and fuel. This has resulted in a sub-stantial and largely
irreversible loss in the diversity of life on Earth.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Approximately 60% (15 out of 24) of the ecosystem services examined
during the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment are being degraded or used
unsustainably, including fresh water, capture fisheries, air and water
purification, and the regulation of regional and local climate, natural
hazards, and pests.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is established but incomplete evidence that changes being made
in ecosystems are increasing the likelihood of nonlinear changes in
ecosystems (including accelerating, abrupt, and potentially irreversible
changes) that have important consequences for human well-being.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Humans are fundamentally, and to a significant extent irreversibly,
changing the diversity of life on Earth, and most of these changes
represent a loss of biodiversity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The harmful effects of the degradation of ecosystem services (the
persistent decrease in the capacity of an ecosystem to deliver services)
are being borne disproportionately by the poor, are contributing to
growing inequities and disparities across groups of people, and are
sometimes the principal factor causing poverty and social conflict.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More land was converted to cropland in the 30 years after 1950 than
in the 150 years between 1700 and 1850. Cultivated systems (areas where
at least 30% of the landscape is in crop-lands, shifting cultivation,
confined livestock production, or freshwater aquaculture) now cover one
quarter of Earth’s terrestrial surface.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The amount of water impounded behind dams quadrupled since 1960, and
three to six times as much water is held in reservoirs as in natural
rivers. Water withdrawals from rivers and lakes doubled since 1960; most
water use (70% worldwide) is for agriculture.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 1960, flows of reactive (biologically available) nitrogen in
terrestrial ecosystems have doubled, and flows of phosphorus have
tripled. More than half of all the synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, which
was first manufactured in 1913, ever used on the planet has been used
since 1985.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since 1750, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has
increased by about 32% (from about 280 to 376 parts per million in
2003), primarily due to the combustion of fossil fuels and land use
changes. Approximately 60% of that increase (60 parts per million) has
taken place since 1959.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>More than two thirds of the area of 2 of the world’s 14 major
terrestrial biomes and more than half of the area of 4 other biomes had
